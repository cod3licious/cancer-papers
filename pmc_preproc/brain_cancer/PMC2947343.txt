Protein kinase C? mediates Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation, Stat3-regulated gene expression and cell invasion in various human cancer cell lines via integration with MAPK cascade (RAF-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2). Protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe), a novel calcium-independent PKC isoform, has been shown to be a transforming oncogene. PKCe-mediated oncogenic activity is linked to its ability to promote cell survival. However, the mechanisms by which PKCe signals cell survival remain elusive. We found that signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), which is constitutively activated in a wide variety of human cancers, is a protein partner of PKCe. Stat3 has two conserved amino acid (Tyr705 and Ser727) residues, which are phosphorylated during Stat3 activation. PKCe interacts with Stat3a isoform which has Ser727 and not with Stat3b isoform which lacks Ser727. PKCe-Stat3 interaction and Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation was initially observed during induction of squamous cell carcinomas and in prostate cancer. Now we present that: 1) PKCe physically interacts with Stat3a isoform in various human cancer cells: skin melanomas (MeWo and WM266-4), gliomas (T98G and MO59K), bladder (RT-4 and UM-UC-3), colon (Caco-2), lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA:MB-231). 2) Inhibition of PKCe expression using specific siRNA inhibits Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation, Stat3-DNA binding, Stat3-regulated gene expression as well as cell invasion. 3) PKCe mediates Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation via integration with the MAPK cascade (RAF-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2). The results indicate that PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation is essential for constitutive activation of Stat3 and cell invasion in various human cancers.

Introduction
Cancer ranks as the second leading cause of death, exceeded only by heart disease in the United States. Each year, about 1.7 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer, and more than a million Americans die of the disease. Cancer develops in almost any organ or tissue of the body, but certain types of cancers are more life threatening than others (Jemal et al., 2009). Defining the molecular mechanisms linked to the transition from normal to cancer cell is essential for planning strategies in the prevention and/or treatment of cancers. Protein Kinase Ce (PKCe) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) have been shown to play roles in the development of several cancers (Aziz et al., 2007a, b, c).
STATs are a family of six [Stat1 (a and b isoforms), Stat2, Stat3 (a and b isoforms), Stat4, Stat5 (a, b isoforms), and Stat6)] latent transcription factors which reside in the cytoplasm and are encoded by seven distinct genes (Klampfer, 2006). STAT activation is linked to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, embryogenesis, and immune responses (Nikitakis et al., 2004; Vinkemeier, 2004; Hodge et al., 2005; Kortylewski et al., 2005). STATs exhibit functional divergence in their roles in oncogenesis. Stat3 and Stat5 promote cell survival while Stat1 has been associated with growth inhibitory effects (Akira, 2000; Stephanou and Latchman, 2005). Constitutively activated STATs, in particular Stat3, are found in a number of human cancers (e.g., head and neck, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), breast, ovary, prostate, and lung) (Chan et al., 2004; Alvarez et al., 2005; Aziz et al., 2007b, c; Rivat et al., 2005; Kobielak and Fuchs, 2006). Since naturally occurring mutations of Stat3 have not been observed, constitutive activation of Stat3 appears to be mediated by aberrant growth factor signaling (Hodge et al., 2005; Klampfer, 2006). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 (Tyrosine 705) is mediated by a wide variety of polypeptides and is essential for Stat3 dimerization and nuclear translocation. Stat3 also has a conserved serine727 residue, which is a target for phosphorylation (Decker and Kovarik, 2000). Evidence indicates that cooperation of both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation is necessary for full activation of Stat3 (Li and Shaw, 2004).
PKC is a major intracellular receptor for the mouse skin tumor promoter TPA (Kazanietz, 2007). PKC represents a large family of phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent serine/threonine kinases (Mellor and Parker, 1998; Mochly-Rosen and Kauvar, 1998; Newton, 2001; Griner and Kazanietz, 2007). Based on structural similarities and co-factor dependency, eleven PKC isoforms have been classified into 3 subfamilies: classical (cPKC), novel (nPKC) and atypical (aPKC) isoforms. The cPKCs (a, bI, bII,g) are dependent on phosphatidylserine (PS), diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+. The nPKCs (d, e, e and th) retain responsiveness to DAG and PS, but do not require Ca2+ for full activation. The aPKCs (l and s) only require PS for their activation (Mochly-Rosen and Kauvar, 1998). PKC isoforms exhibit functional specificity in their signals to oncogenesis (Griner and Kazanietz, 2007). PKCe participates in the regulation of diverse cellular functions including gene expression, neoplastic transformation, cell adhesion, mitogenicity, and cellular motility. Overexpression of PKCe in rodent fibroblasts leads to increase in growth rates, anchorage independence, and tumor formation in nude mice (reviewed in Basu and Sivaprasad, 2007). PKCe has been shown to be a transforming oncogene (Basu and Sivaprasad, 2007), and a predictive biomarker of various human cancers (Pan et al., 2005) including prostate cancer (PCa) (Wu et al., 2002). We found PKCe is linked to the development of SCC (Reddig et al., 2000; Jansen et al., 2001; Wheeler et al., 2003; 2004; 2005). PKCe is also overexpressed in human PCa (Cornford et al., 1999). Overexpression of PKCe transforms androgen dependent (AD) LNCaP tumor cells to an androgen independent (AI) variant (Wu et al., 2002). The transformation of AD to an AI variant was associated with increased cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (Wu et al., 2004).
We have shown that PKCe interacts with Stat3, phosphorylates Stat3Ser727, and increases both DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of Stat3 in skin (Aziz et al., 2007b, c) and prostate cancers (Aziz et al., 2007a). However, it is unknown whether association of PKCe with Stat3 is universal. We present novel results in this communication: 1) PKCe interacts with Stat3 and phosphorylates Stat3Ser727 in various human cancer cells: skin melanoma (MeWo and WM266-4), glioma (T98G and MO59K), bladder (RT-4 and UM-UC-3), colon (Caco-2), lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA:MB-231). 2) Inhibition of PKCe expression, using PKCe specific siRNA, inhibits Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation, Stat3-DNA binding, Stat3-regulated gene expression as well as cell invasion not only in PCa but also in several others cancer cell lines including melanoma, glioma, pancreas and lung. 3) PKCe may integrate with MAPK cascade (Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2) to phosphorylate Stat3Ser727.

Results
1. PKCe and Stat3 interaction in various human cancer cell lines
Various human cancer cell lines were used to test the hypothesis that the association of PKCe with Stat3 is universal. The interaction of PKCe with Stat3 in glioma (T98G and MO59K) and breast (MCF-7, MDA:MB-231) cancer cell lines is shown in Figure 1. T98G is a glioblastoma mutiformae fibroblast cell and not tumorigenic in nude mice whereas M059K is a malignant gliomblastoma fibroblast and forms tumors in SCID mice. Expression levels of PKCe and Stat3 in T98G and M059K are shown in Figure 1ai. The basal levels of PKCe expression were higher (32%) in M059K compared with T98G cells. Stat3 has two conserved amino acid (Tyr705 and Ser727) residues, which are phosphorylated during Stat3 activation. PKCe only interacts with Stat3a isoform which has Ser727 and not with Stat3b isoform which lacks Ser727. Also, MO59K elicited a high level of pStat3Tyr705a (53%), pStat3Tyr705b (537%), and pStat3Ser727 (64%) as compared to T98G cells (Figure 1 bi). PKCe and Stat3 interaction in estrogen-dependent MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and estrogen-independent MDA:MB-231 human breast cancer cells is also shown in Figure 1. MDA:MB-231 as compared to MCF-7, exhibited high expression levels of PKCe (63%) pStat3Tyr705 (225%) and pStat3Ser727 (255%) (Figure 1aii, 1bii). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation/blotting experiments indicate that PKCe physically interacts with Stat3 in glioblastoma and breast cell lines (Figure 1ci, ii). As shown in Figure 1ciii, the inclusion of blocking peptide (BP) in the immunoprecipitation experiments inhibited the interaction of PKCe with Stat3, providing straightforward evidence for the protein-protein interactions of PKCe and Stat3. Each immunoprecipitation experiment included a control that contained no primary antibody but pre-immune rabbit serum. Neither PKCe nor Stat3 was pulled down with the pre-immune serum. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibody from different commercial suppliers. Irrespective of the source of the antibody, the results were identical. The co-localization of PKCe with Stat3 was confirmed by double immunofluorscence staining (Figure 1d). Merge images (yellow fluorescence) indicate localization of both PKCe and Stat3 in cytoplasm and nucleus.
The interaction of PKCe with Stat3 in human melanoma (MeWo and WM266-4), lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H1650), colon adenocarcinoma Caco2 cells, pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1) and bladder cancer cells (RT-4, UM-UC-3) is illustrated in Figure 2. WM266-4 is an aggressive metastatic melanoma cell line, while MeWo is a nonmetastatic melanoma cell line. As compared to MeWo, WM266-4 cells elicited higher expression levels of PKCe (161%), pStat3Tyr705a (195%), pStat3Tyr705b (133%) and pStat3Ser727 (167%) (Figure 2ai, 2bi). Similarly, merge images depict significant localization of PKCe and Stat3 in metastatic melanoma cell lines WM266-4 (Fig. 2di). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation/blotting experiments (Figure 2c) reveal that PKCe physically interacts with Stat3. PKCe and Stat3 expression levels in lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1) and bladder cancer (RT-4, UM-UC-3) were high, as compared to human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) (Figure 2aii). It is noteworthy that shift in the mobility of PKCe-immunoprecipitated Stat3 in the western blots (Figure 2c) is perhaps due to the fact that only phosphorylated Stat3 interacts with PKCe. In accord with our results with other human cancer cell lines (Figure 1), PKCe and Stat3 colocalize (Figure 2d) and PKCe interacts with Stat3 (Figure 2c) in lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1) and bladder cancer (RT-4 and UM-UC-3) cell lines. . PKCe-Stat3 interaction was not cell-type specific
2. Functional consequence of PKCe interaction with Stat3
To determine that PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation is essential for Stat3 DNA-binding, Stat3 regulated gene expression and cell invasion, we used PKCe specific siRNA to silence PKCe in melonoma (WM266-4), glioma (T98G), pancreatic (PANC-1), and lung (H1650) cancer cells. In this experiment (Figure 3), PKCe specific siRNA was transfected in all the cancer cells to inhibit PKCe expression. Silencing of PKCe using PKCe siRNA resulted in significant inhibition of PKCe without inhibition of expression of other Protein Kinase C isoforms such as PKCd and PKCa (Figure 3a).
Inhibition of PKCe attenuated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation but not Stat3Tyr705 phosphorylation (Figure 3b). Inhibition of PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation (Figure 3b) accompanied inhibition of Stat3-DNA binding (data not shown), Stat3-regulated gene expression (Figure 3c). The results indicate that inhibition of PKC epsilon results in suppression of both Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation and Stat3-regulated gene expression. However, the effects are indeed cell-type specific. Silencing of PKCe significantly (p<0.01) inhibited cell invasion in melonoma (WM266-4), glioma (T98G), pancreatic (PANC-1), and lung (H1650) cancer cells.
3. PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation involves integration with MAPK cascade (RAF-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2)
The results (Figure 1-Figure 3) presented clearly indicate that PKCe interacts with Stat3. However, it is unknown whether PKCe interacts with other protein kinase cascade to phosphorylate Stat3Ser727. To explore the possibility that PKCe-Stat3 interaction is mediated through other protein kinases, we used prostate cancer from TRAMP (Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate) mice and DU145 cells. In reciprocal immunoprecipitation/ blotting experiments, employing PCa from TRAMP mice, Raf-1, MEK-1/2, and ERK1/2 co-immunoprecipitated with PKCe and Stat3 (Figure 4a).
To further determine whether PKCe mediates Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation via activation of MAPK cascade (Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2), we used siRNAs to silence PKCe in DU145 cells (Figure 4b). The transfection was done as per the manufacturer's instructions (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO). A pool of four specific siRNA oligonucleotides directed against PKCe was transfected into DU-145 cells to inhibit PKCe synthesis and non-targeting siRNA was used as a control (Figure 4b). Inhibition of PKCe (93%) in DU145 cells using PKCe specific siRNA inhibited the phosphorylation of Raf-1Ser338 (55%), pMEK1/2 (38%), pERK1 (53%), pERK2 (58%) and COX-2 (59%) without affecting total Raf-1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 levels (Figure 4c and e). In a separate experiment (Figure 5), silencing of ERK1/2 using ERK1/2 specific siRNA inhibited PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation. Taken together, the results indicate that PKCe may integrate with MAPK cascade to phosphorylate Stat3Ser727.

Discussion
PKCe, a Ca2+-independent-phospholipid-dependent PKC, is linked to cancer induction, progression, and metastasis (Basu and Sivaprasad, 2007; Griner and Kazanietz, 2007). PKCe is constitutively activated in various human cancers and PKCe levels correlates with aggressiveness of human cancers including breast (Pan et al., 2005), HNSCC (Pan et al., 2006), prostate (Aziz et al., 2007a), lung (Bae et al., 2007), brain (Okhrimenko et al., 2005), and SCC (Aziz et al., 2007b, c). Also, when PKCe is over expressed, it transforms rat fibroblasts, colonic epithelial cells, and androgen-dependent LNCaP cells to an androgen-independent variant (Wu et al., 2002). Constitutively activated PKCe regulates the activation of signaling networks linked to cell survival (Basu and Sivaprasad, 2007). We have previously reported both in skin (Aziz et al., 2007b, c) and prostate (Aziz et al., 2007a) cancer that PKCe may mediate inhibition of apoptosis and promotion of survival of neoplastic cells via its association with Stat3, a transcription factor that is constitutively activated in various human cancers (Kobielak and Fuchs, 2000; Chan et al., 2004; Alvarez et al., 2005; Aziz et al., 2007c; Rivat et al., 2005). PKCe interacts with Stat3, phosphorylates Stat3Ser727, and regulates both Stat3-DNA binding and transcriptional activity (Aziz et al., 2007a, c). Now, we present that PKCe regulates Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation, not only in skin and prostate, but also in several cancer cell lines: skin melanomas (MeWo and WM266-4), glioma (T98G and MO59K), bladder (RT-4 and UM-UC-3), colon (Caco-2), lung (H1650), pancreatic (PANC-1), and breast (MCF-7 and MDA:MB-231). PKCe integrates with MAPK cascade to phosphorylate Stat3Ser727 (Figure 4 and Figure 5). PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation is essential for cancer cell invasion (Figure 1-Figure 5).
PKCe is overexpressed and constitutively activated in various human cancers (e.g., glioma, melanoma, breast, prostate) (Wu et al., 2002, 2004; Okhrimenko et al., 2005; Pan et al., 2005; Aziz et al., 2007a, c). The present results with various human cancer cell lines further support the evidence for increased expression levels of PKCe in cancer (Figure 1-Figure 3). The mechanism linked to increased PKCe protein stability in cancer is not defined. The signaling lifetime of PKC is under the control of multiple mechanisms (Chen et al., 2007). PKC is synthesized in the cytoplasm as an inactive precursor. A series of ordered phosphorylation converts PKC into a mature stable species. Binding to lipid second messenger controls the propagation of PKC signals. Termination of PKC signaling is achieved by mechanisms which include: dephosphorylation and proteolytic degradation and degradation of fully phosphorylated PKC by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (Chen et al., 2007). Several studies indicate that PKC isozymes become ubiquitinated following activation. PKCa, d, and e have been reported to become ubiquitinated following treatment of cells with phorbol esters or another potent PKC agonist, bryostatin. Both proteasome-sensitive and -insensitive pathways have been proposed to regulate PKC degradation. The specific machinery controlling the degradation of unprocessed or activated PKC remains to be elucidated. Chen et al., 2007 from Dr. Alexandra C. Newton's laboratory discovered the role of novel E3 ubiquitin ligase in ubiquitination and degradation of PKC isozymes. Increased PKCe expression level in aggressive cancers may be result of increased PKCe synthesis and/or decreased degradation. Decreased degradation may be the result of either decreased expression of E3 ligase (RINCK1) or/and lack of recognition of PKCe by E3 ligase. Many RING domain proteins such as MDM2, C-Chol, a BRCA1, have intrinsic E3 ligase activities and regulate cellular proteins. It is also notable that breast cancer-associated gene-2 (BCA2), a novel RING domain protein, has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and correlates with the outcome in invasive breast cancer (Burger et al., 2005; 2006).
The novel finding is the observation that PKCe is an initial signal that regulates human cancer cell invasion (Figure 3d). This is accomplished via phosphorylation of Stat3Ser727. The experiments involving use of PKCe specific siRNA provide unequivocal evidence that PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation is the key event in the constitutive activation of Stat3, Stat3-DNA binding, and Stat3-regulated gene expression.
PKCe is linked to the induction and progression of human cancers (Aziz et al., 2007a, c; Griner and Kazanietz, 2007). PKCe accomplishes its oncogenic role via mediation of anti-apoptotic and pro-survival signals (Basu and Sivaprasad, 2007; Griner and Kazanietz, 2007). We were the first to discover that PKCe signals oncogenic activity through activation of Stat3 (Aziz et al., 2007a, b). Stat3 is a protein partner of PKCe. Stat3 is constitutively activated in human cancers. PKCe interacts with Stat3 to phosphorylate Stat3Ser727 which is essential for Stat3 transcription activity and cell invasion. The results of reciprocal/blotting experiments (Figure 1 and Figure 2) clearly illustrate that PKCe physically interacts with Stat3. PKCe-Stat3 interaction was observed in various human cancer cell lines, implying that PKCe activation may be an initial signal in the constitutive activation of Stat3 in wide-variety of human cancers.
Depending upon the cellular context, Stat3 has been shown to be a substrate for several protein kinases (Jain et al., 1999). Stat3 has been shown to be an in vitro substrate for MAP kinase and/or ERKs, which raises the possibility that Stat3 integrates signals from MAP kinases. Members of the MAPK and JNK families of serine kinases may mediate serine 727 phosphorylation (Xuan et al., 2005). Pioneering research from Dr. Zigang Dong's laboratory shows that UV-induced Ser727 phosphorylation in both Stat1 and Stat3 involves the integration of multiple kinase pathways (Zhang et al., 2001, 2003; Zykova et al., 2005). Our results indicate, using PKCe RNA interference experiments, that PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation involves integration of the MAPK cascade (Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2) (Figures 4a-c).
In summary, PKCe activation is an initial signal in the constitutive activation of Stat3 that is observed in a wide variety of human cancer cells (Figure 1-Figure 3). PKCe integrates with MAPK cascade to phosphorylate Stat3Ser727 (Figure 4 and Figure 5). PKCe-mediated Stat3Ser727 phosphorylation is essential for constitutive activation of Stat3 (Figure 3). PKCe is constitutively activated in human cancers (Figure 1 and Figure 2) and is linked to cancer invasion (Figure 3). We conclude that PKCe is an initial signal which directs its partner Stat3 to maintain the invasive cancer. PKCe and Stat3 are potential targets for human cancer prevention and treatment.

Western Blot Analysis
Indicated human cancer cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer (50 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES, pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 ug/ml aprotinin, 10 ug/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 200 mM Na3VO4, 200 mM NaF and 1 mM EGTA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14 000xg for 30 min at 4degC. Twenty five ug of whole cell lysate was fractionated on on 10-15% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels for western blot analysis as described before (Aziz et al., 2007a, c).
Determination of PKCe and Stat3 localization by double immunofluorescence staining
Formalin-fixed human cancer cells were used to determine the localization of PKCe and Stat3 as described before (Aziz et al., 2007a, c).
Transfection
Cells were transiently transcfected with PKCe-siRNA (2umol/L/100-mm Petri dish), PKCe-siRNA plasmid (15 ug/dish) as per the manufacturer's instruction (Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette). For ERK1/2 siRNA transfection, DU-145 cells were serum starved with for 24 hrs prior to transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with (120 nmoles of ERK1 siRNA+ 120 nmoles ERK2 siRNA) or 240 nmoles of non-targeting siRNA and were harvested 48 hrs post-transfection. Whole cell lysates were made and 25 ug of protein was subjected for Western blot analysis.
Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion was assayed using a Collagen-Based Cell Invasion Assay kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Temecula, CA). Briefly, WM266-4 (melanoma), PANC-1 (pancreatic), Caco-2 (colon) and H1650 (lung) cancer cells at 80% confluency were serum starved 18 to 24 h before the assay. The cells were harvested and the pellets was gently resuspended in serum-free medium. In the upper chamber, 0.5 x 106 cells per well were plated in triplicates and incubated for 2 h at 37degC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 before PKCe specific siRNA plasmid transfection. Both the insert and the holding well were subjected to the same medium composition with the exception of serum. The insert contained no serum, whereas the lower well contained 10% fetal bovine serum that served as a chemoattractant. 15 ug of PKCe specific siRNA plasmid was then transfected into the cells. An equal amount of non-targeting siRNA plasmid was used as a control (Ambion, Austin, TX). Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, the cell invasion assay was done as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cells in the insert were removed by wiping gently with a cotton swab. Migrated cells sticking to the bottom side of the insert were stained with Cell Stain. Invading cells on the bottom side of the membrane were photographed using a light inverted microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TS 100) at 40x magnification. In addition, the number of cells migrated to the bottom side was estimated by colorimetric measurements at 560 nm. Mean +- SE was calculated from three independent experiments.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear protein extracts from the indicated cells were prepared by lysing cells in a hypotonic solution (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 10 mM KCl; 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 0.1 mM EGTA pH 8.0; 1 mM DTT; 0.5 mM PMSF; 0.5 mg/ml benzamide; 2 ug/ml aprotinin; 2 ug/ml leupeptin), with detergent (NP-40 at 6.25% (v/v)) followed by low speed (1500 x g for 30 secs) to collect nuclei. Nuclear proteins were extracted in a high-salt buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; .4 M NaCl; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 1 mM EGTA pH 8.0; 1 mM DTT; 1 mM PMSF; 0.5 mg/ml benzamide; 2 ug/ml aprotinin; 2 ug/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 15 mins; nuclear membranes and genomic DNA removed by high-speed (16,000xg) centrifugation at 4degC for 5 minutes. The nuclear protein extract was incubated in a final volume of 20 ul of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 80 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 ug/ml poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid) for 15 minutes. g-p32-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides of the consensus binding sequences of Stat3, were then added and the complexes were incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% acrylamide gel containing, 2.5% glycerol and 0.5X Tris-borate EDTA at room temperature. Gels were dried and autoradiographed to determine binding activity (Aziz et al., 2007a)
