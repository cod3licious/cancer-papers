[Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion]

PPARg agonists regulate the expression of stemness and differentiation genes in brain tumour stem cells. Background: Brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) are a small population of cancer cells that exhibit self-renewal, multi-drug resistance, and recurrence properties. We have shown earlier that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) agonists inhibit the expansion of BTSCs in T98G and U87MG glioma. In this study, we analysed the influence of PPARg agonists on the expression of stemness and differentiation genes in BTSCs.   Methods: The BTSCs were isolated from T98G and DB29 glioma cells, and cultured in neurobasal medium with epidermal growth factor+basic fibroblast growth factor. Proliferation was measured by WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2 H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulphonate) and 3H thymidine uptake assays, and gene expression was analysed by quantitative reverse--transcription PCR and Taqman array. The expression of CD133, SRY box 2, and nanog homeobox (Nanog) was also evaluated by western blotting, immunostaining, and flow cytometry.   Results: We found that PPARg agonists, ciglitazone and 15-deoxy-D12,14-ProstaglandinJ2, inhibited cell viability and proliferation of T98G- and DB29-BTSCs. The PPARg agonists reduced the expansion of CD133+ BTSCs and altered the expression of stemness and differentiation genes. They also inhibited Sox2 while enhancing Nanog expression in BTSCs.   Conclusion: These findings highlight that PPARg agonists inhibit BTSC proliferation in association with altered expression of Sox2, Nanog, and other stemness genes. Therefore, targeting stemness genes in BTSCs could be a novel strategy in the treatment of glioblastoma.

Materials and methods
Glioma cell culture
Human glioblastoma cell line T98G was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). DB29 primary human glioma cells were established in our laboratory by culturing surgically removed brain tumour tissue samples obtained from the tissue repository at Methodist Research Institute with an IRB approved protocol. Glioma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, 1 m sodium pyruvate, 100 U ml-1 penicillin G, 100 mg ml-1 streptomycin, 2 m glutamine, 1 m MEM non-essential amino acids, and 50 m 2b-mercaptoethanol in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 degC. The cells were dissociated using 0.25% trypsin with 0.05 m EDTA solution and sub-cultured once in 3-5 days (Chearwae and Bright, 2008; Chakraborty et al, 2011).
Brain tumour stem cell culture
To induce the growth and expansion of BTSCs as gliospheres, we adopted a culture condition established in our laboratory (Chearwae and Bright, 2008; Chakraborty et al, 2011). Briefly, T98G and DB29 glioma cells were cultured in neurobasal medium (NBM) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen, Madison, WI, USA) in the presence of 10 ng ml-1 EGF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and bFGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The BTSCs (5 x 104 ml per well) were cultured in 12-well plates in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 oC, and 5 to 7-day-old gliospheres were used for the experiments.
Proliferation assay
The effect of PPARg agonists on the proliferation of glioma and BTSCs was measured by WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2 H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulphonate); Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and 3H thymidine uptake assays. Briefly, T98G and BD29 glioma cells were cultured in 96-well tissue-culture plates (1 x 104/200 ml per well) in DMEM in the presence of 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 degC. T98G- and DB29-BTSCs were obtained by dissociating 5 to 7-day-old gliospheres generated as above by treatment with Accutase (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, MO, USA) for 15 min at 37 oC. The BTSCs were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates (1 x 104/200 ml per well) in NBM in the presence of B27 and 10 ng ml-1 EGF+bFGF in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 oC. Different concentrations of PPARg agonists, ciglitazone (CalBiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) or 15d-PGJ2 (Sigma Chemicals), were added at the initiation of culture and compared with the DMSO-treated control. The WST-1 reagent (10 ml per well) was added at 46 h, and the OD was measured at 450 nm after 48 h using a titre-plate reader (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX, USA). 3H thymidine (0.5 m Ci per well) was added at 24 h, and cells were harvested after 48 h using a Tomtec 96 harvester (Tomtec, Hamden, CT, USA). The amount of 3H thymidine uptake was measured using Wallac Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer, Fremont, CA, USA).
Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
The effect of PPARg agonists on the expression of stemness and differentiation genes in BTSCs was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) technique. Briefly, T98G- and DB29-BTSCs were cultured in NBM with 10 ng ml-1 EGF and bFGF with different concentrations of ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 at 37 oC for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Equal amount of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, and qRT-PCR was performed using 384-well TaqMan Low-Density Human Stem Cell Gene Array Card in 7900 HT fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). To examine the mRNA expression of Sox2 and Nanog, RNA samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA, using random primer and master mix from TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ, USA). The cDNA samples were then amplified in TaqMan Universal Master Mix with optimised concentrations of Sox2 and Nanog primer sets in a standard optical 96-well reaction plate. Results were analysed using Prism 7900 relative quantification (DDCt) study software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Heat map was constructed using the DataAssist software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Box plot, scatter plot, and Venn diagrams were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis
The effect of PPARg agonists on the expression of proteins in BTSCs was determined by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Briefly, T98G- and DB29-BTSCs were cultured in NBM with 10 ng ml-1 EGF+bFGF in the presence of different concentrations of ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 at 37 oC for 24 h. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, and whole-cell lysates were prepared by boiling in lysis buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 0.8 mg ml-1 SDS, 4% glycerol, 0.588  b-mercaptoethanol, 0.05  EDTA, 8 mg ml-1 bromophenol blue) for 5 min. Total protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE using a mini-gel apparatus (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to a nylon/PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) using a Novablot transfer system (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The residual binding sites in the membrane were blocked by incubating with PBST (PBS and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk powder for 1 h. The blots were incubated with rabbit anti-Sox2, rabbit anti-Nanog, goat anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), rabbit anti-chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan 4 (NG2), mouse anti-b-III Tubulin, mouse anti-CD133, or mouse anti-b-actin antibody (1 : 500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in PBST containing 1% non-fat milk powder at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then washed in PBST and incubated with corresponding peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (1 : 2500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS containing 1% milk powder for 1 h. The blots were then developed using Super-signal West-pico chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
Immunostaining and flow cytometry
The effect of PPARg agonists on the expansion of CD133+, Sox2+ or Nanog+ BTSCs was analysed by immunostaining and flow cytometry. T98G- and DB29-BTSCs were cultured in 12-well tissue-culture plates in NBM with B27 and 10 ng ml-1 EGF+bFGF in the absence or presence of 10 m ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 degC. After 24 or 48 h, BTSCs were dissociated using Accutase for 15 min at 37 oC and suspended in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilised using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Bioscience Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) at room temperature for 15 min. The BTSCs were washed and incubated with PE-conjugated anti-CD133 antibody (1 : 10, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) in PBS with 0.1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were also stained with anti-Nanog or anti-Sox2 antibody (1 : 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in BD Perm/Wash buffer at 4 degC for 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated with DyLight 633-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 200, Thermo Scientific) at 4 oC for 30 min. DyLight 633 (1 : 200) and PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 antibody (1 : 10, Miltenyi Biotec) were used as isotype controls. The percentage of CD133+, Sox2+, or Nanog+ BTSCs was analysed using FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
For immunostaining, T98G and DB29 gliospheres were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, washed, and stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD133 antibody (1 : 10, Miltenyi Biotec) in PBS with 0.1% BSA at 4 degC for 1 h. Gliospheres were also stained with anti-Sox2 and anti-Nanog antibody (1 : 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in BD Perm/Wash buffer at 4 degC for 30 min, followed by incubation with DyLight 594-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 2000, Thermo Scientific) at 4 oC for 30 min. DyLight 594-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 2000) and PE-conjugated mouse IgG1 antibody (1 : 10, Miltenyi Biotec) were used as isotype controls. Gliospheres were mounted on a glass slide using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and photographed using Leica Leitz DMRB fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA).

The data was analysed by one-way ANOVA using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. The values are mean+-s.d./s.e.m., and the significance is expressed as *P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001 in the figures.

Results
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists inhibit the proliferation of glioma and BTSCs in culture
To investigate the use of PPARg agonists for the treatment of glioblastoma, we first examined the effect of PPARg agonists on the viability of glioma cells in culture. As shown in Figure 1A and B, addition of a PPARg agonist, ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in T98G glioma viability, reaching a significant effect at 5 m. Similarly, PPARg agonists also induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability in DB29 primary human glioma in culture (Figure 1C and D). Both T98G and DB29 glioma cells showed comparable inhibitory response to ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 in culture.
To determine the potential use of PPARg agonists for BTSC-targeted therapy in glioblastoma, we then examined the proliferation of BTSCs using the WST-1 assay. We found that in vitro culture of BTSCs isolated from T98G and DB29 glioma grew and expanded in NBM supplemented with EGF+bFGF. Interestingly, addition of 1, 5, 10, and 25 m ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of both T98G- and DB29-BTSCs in culture (Figure 1). To confirm the results, we then examined the proliferation of BTSCs using the 3H thymidine uptake assay. As shown in Figure 1, addition of 1, 5, 10, and 25 m PPARg agonists resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation of both T98G- and DB29-BTSCs. These findings highlight the use of PPARg agonists for BTSC-targeted therapy in glioblastoma.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists inhibit CD133+ BTSC expansion and promote differentiation
To determine the effect of PPARg agonists on BTSCs, we examined the expression of CD133, an important stemness marker, in T98G- and DB29-BTSCs. We found that in vitro treatment with PPARg agonists significantly reduced the percentage of CD133+ cells (Figure 2A and B). The T98G glioma cells cultured in DMEM showed 4.24% CD133+ cells with a mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of 76.68, whereas T98G-BTSCs cultured in NBM showed 73.68% CD133+ cells with an MFI of 113.60 (Figure 2A). The percentage of CD133+ cells in T98G-BTSCs decreased to 41.47 and 35.24% with an MFI of 114.04 and 78.44 following treatment with ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2, respectively. Similarly, DB29 glioma cultured in DMEM showed 8.98% CD133+ cells with an MFI of 70.58, whereas DB29-BTSCs cultured in NBM showed 34.64% CD133+ cells with an MFI of 84.06 (Figure 2B). Treatment of DB29-BTSCs with ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 also reduced the percentage of CD133+ cells to 28.56 and 25.55% with an MFI of 56.78 and 68.04, respectively.
Western blot analyses showed that gliospheres express detectable levels of CD133 that decreased after treatment with PPARg agonists in culture (Figure 3). To examine if the inhibition of stemness marker CD133 was associated with an increase in the expression of differentiation markers, we treated T98G- and DB29-BTSCs with ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 for 24 h, and analysed their protein expression by western blot. As shown in Figure 3E, we found that T98G glioma cells expressed detectable level of astrocyte marker GFAP that decreased in T98G-BTSCs and increased after treatment with 10 m ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2. DB29 glioma and BTSCs showed low expression of GFAP that also increased after treatment with ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 (Figure 3E). We have also found that both T98G and DB29 glioma cells expressed early oligodendrocyte marker NG2 that decreased in BTSCs and increased after treatment with PPARg agonists, but more so in DB29-BTSCs than T98G-BTSCs (Figure 3E). The expression of neuronal marker b-III Tubulin was not detected in T98G- and DB29-BTSCs cultured in the absence or presence of PPARg agonists. These results suggest that PPARg agonists induce glial differentiation of BTSCs in glioma.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists alter the expression of differentiation genes in BTSCs
To further define the molecular mechanisms of PPARg agonists, we then examined the effect of ciglitazone on the expression of 50 differentiation genes in DB29- and T98G-BTSCs using the TaqMan Low-Density Human Stem Cell Gene Array Card (384 wells). As shown in Figure 3A, the heat map shows significant changes in the gene expression profile of DB29- and T98G-BTSCs after treatment with ciglitazone (Figure 3A). Box-plot and scatter-plot analyses also showed significant alteration in the expression of various differentiation genes in DB29- and T98G-BTSCs after treatment with ciglitazone in culture (Figure 3B and C). As presented in Table 1, DB29-BTSCs showed a100-fold increase in the transcription of 10- and 1 to 100-fold increase in 14 differentiation genes, whereas 3 differentiation genes went from ND to D (not detected to detected). DB29-BTSCs also showed a 1 to 10-fold decrease in 4 and 10 to 100-fold decrease in 5, whereas 11 differentiation genes went from D to ND. The T98G-BTSCs showed100-fold increase in the expression of 4 and a 1 to 100-fold increase in 7, whereas 9 differentiation factors went from ND to D after treatment with ciglitazone. The T98G-BTSCs also showed a 1 to 100-fold decrease in 12 and a100-fold decrease in 11, whereas 6 differentiation genes went from D to ND. We have also found that three differentiation genes (COL1A1, IAPP, and NEUROD1) were not detected (ND to ND) before and after treatment with ciglitazone in DB29-BTSCs, whereas DDX4 is the only differentiation gene not detected before and after treatment with ciglitazone in T98G-BTSCs (Table 1).
Further analyses showed that the in vitro treatment with ciglitazone increased the expression of a total of 27 differentiation genes in DB29-BTSCs and 20 differentiation genes in T98G-BTSCs (Figure 3D). Among them, the expression of 11 common differentiation genes (PECAM1, COL2A1, CGB, TH, NES, CDX2, GCM1, AFP, SST, RUNX2, and ISL1) was upregulated by ciglitazone in both DB29- and T98G-BTSCs.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists alter the expression of stemness genes in BTSCs
We also analysed the expression of 40 stemness genes by qRT-PCR using TaqMan Low-Density Human Stem Cell Gene Array Card (384 wells). We found that the in vitro treatment with ciglitazone significantly altered the expression of stemness genes in DB29- and T98G-BTSCs compared with the DMSO-treated control cells (Figure 3A). Box-plot and scatter-plot analyses also showed significant alteration in the expression of various stemness genes in DB29- and T98G-BTSCs after treatment with ciglitazone in culture (Figure 3B and C). Interestingly, DB29-BTSCs showed100-fold increase in the transcription of 9 genes and a 1 to 100-fold increase in 8 stemness genes, whereas 6 stemness genes increased from ND to D levels after treatment with ciglitazone (Table 2). DB29-BTSCs also showed a 1 to 10-fold decrease in the expression of 4 and 10 to 100-fold decrease in 4 stemness genes, whereas 4 stemness genes went from D to ND after treatment with ciglitazone. Similarly, ciglitazone-treated T98G-BTSCs showed a100-fold increase in the transcription of 2 genes and a 1 to 100-fold increase in 10 stemness genes, whereas 3 stemness genes went from ND to D. Moreover, T98G-BTSCs treated with ciglitazone also showed a 1 to 10-fold decrease in the expression of 11 and a 10 to 100-fold decrease in 5 stemness genes, whereas 8 stemness genes went from D to ND. We have also found that five stemness genes (CD9, CRABP2, IFITM1, IFITM2, and NR5A2) were not detected (ND to ND) before and after treatment with ciglitazone in DB29-BTSCs, whereas two stemness genes (GRB7, FGF4) were not detected before and after treatment with ciglitazone in T98G-BTSCs (Table 2).
Further analyses showed that the in vitro treatment with ciglitazone resulted in the downregulation of a total of 12 stemness genes in DB29-BTSCs and 24 stemness genes in T98G-BTSCs (Figure 3D). Among them, the expression of eight common stemness genes (DNMT3B, IMP2, NR6A1, GDX4, FGF5, SOX2, POU5F1, and UTF1) was reduced by ciglitazone in DB29- and T98G-BTSCs. Interestingly, Sox2 expression was inhibited by ciglitazone in both DB29- and T98G-BTSCs, whereas Nanog expression was increased in DB29-BTSCs while remaining relatively unchanged in T98G-BTSCs. These results indicate that the PPARg agonists differentially regulate the expression of a multitude of stemness and differentiation factors in BTSCs.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists alter the expression of Sox2 in BTSCs
To understand the mechanism by which PPARg agonists inhibit the growth of BTSCs, we then examined the expression of Sox2 mRNA by qRT-PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 4A, T98G-BTSCs cultured in NBM with EGF+bFGF expressed higher level of Sox2 mRNA following the addition of 1 and 5 m ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2, but expressed lower levels of Sox2 after treatment with 10 and 25 m PPARg agonists. Similarly, western blot analysis also showed that the in vitro treatment of T98G-BTSCs with ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 induced the expression of Sox2 protein at 1 and 5 m, but inhibited its expression back to the starting level at 10 and 25 m doses. In the case of DB29-BTSCs, qRT-PCR analysis showed that cells cultured in NBM with EGF+bFGF expressed detectable levels of Sox2 mRNA (Figure 4B). However, treatment with ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 resulted in a decrease of Sox2 mRNA and protein expression in DB29-BTSCs. These results suggest that PPARg agonists may modulate the growth of BTSCs by altering the expression of Sox2.
To examine whether the inhibition of Sox2 expression was associated with a decrease in Sox2+ BTSCs, we then analysed the effect of PPARg agonists on the percentage of Sox2+ cells in culture. As shown in Figure 4C, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that T98G-BTSCs cultured in NBM with EGF+bFGF generated gliospheres with significant number of Sox2+ cells. Flow cytometry analyses showed that T98G-BTSCs constitute 65% of Sox2+ cells with an MFI of 44 that decreased to 57, and 9% with an MFI of 15 and 16 following treatment with 10 m ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2, respectively. Similarly, DB29 gliospheres cultured in NBM with EGF+bFGF constitute 59% of Sox2+ BTSCs with an MFI of 58 that decreased to 30 and 21%, with an MFI of 40 and 35 following treatment with ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2, respectively (Figure 4D). Although both PPARg agonists inhibited the expansion of Sox2+ BTSCs, treatment with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in a more significant inhibition of Sox2 expression in both T98G- and DB29-BTSCs. These findings suggest that PPARg agonists modulate the expansion of Sox2+ BTSCs in glioma.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists alter the expression of Nanog in BTSCs
To further examine the effect of PPARg agonists on BTSCs, we then analysed the expression of Nanog mRNA by qRT-PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 5A, T98G-BTSCs cultured in NBM with EGF+bFGF expressed detectable level of Nanog mRNA, which increased significantly after treatment with ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in culture. Western blot analysis also showed that PPARg agonists upregulated the Nanog expression in T98G-BTSCs. Additionally, DB29-BTSCs cultured in NBM with EGF+bFGF expressed low levels of Nanog, which was elevated after treatment with 1, 5, 10, and 25 m ciglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in culture (Figure 5B), suggesting the alteration of Nanog expression by PPARg agonists in BTSCs.
To examine whether the induction of Nanog expression was associated with an increase in Nanog+ BTSCs, we then analysed the effect of PPARg agonists on the percentage of Nanog+ cells in culture. As shown in Figure 5C and D, immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of Nanog expression in T98G- and DB29-BTSCs. Flow cytometry analyses showed that T98G gliospheres constitute 76% of Nanog+ BTSCs that remained at 76 and 74% after treatment with ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2, respectively. However, the MFI was slightly changed, as the DMSO-treated T98G-BTSCs showed an MFI of 50 that increased to 57 and 56, following treatment with ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2, respectively (Figure 5C). DB29 gliospheres constituted 95% of Nanog+ BTSCs that slightly increased to 99 and 100%, following treatment with ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2, respectively. The DMSO-treated DB29-BTSCs showed an MFI of 36 that significantly increased to 113 and 98, following treatment with ciglitazone and 15d-PGJ2, respectively (Figure 5D). These findings suggest that PPARg agonists modulate the expansion of Nanog+ BTSCs in glioma.

Discussion
The BTSCs represent a small fraction of self-renewing cancer cells that are resistant to therapy and responsible for brain tumour recurrence. Recent studies have established suitable conditions to expand CD133+ BTSCs as gliospheres in culture (Chearwae and Bright, 2008; Chakraborty et al, 2011). The EGF and bFGF are two important growth factors that are commonly used to maintain the self-renewal and multipotency of BTSCs. Growing evidence suggests that deregulated signalling pathways contribute to the continuous expansion of self-renewing CSCs in tumour (Pardal et al, 2003; Das et al, 2008; Kim and Dirks, 2008). Many glioma patients express elevated levels of EGF receptor, which is undetectable in normal brain (Martens et al, 2008). Likewise, bFGF is induced during reactive gliosis (Finklestein et al, 1988; Frautschy et al, 1991), and its overexpression seems prevalent in glioma (Murphy et al, 1989; Morrison et al, 1994). In this study, we have confirmed our earlier findings that PPARg agonists inhibit the EGF- and bFGF-induced growth and expansion of BTSCs in culture (Chearwae and Bright, 2008). We have also found that PPARg agonists inhibit CD133 expression and promote the expression of glial differentiation markers in BTSCs.
We found that the in vitro treatment of BTSCs with ciglitazone significantly altered the expression of various stemness and differentiation genes. One of the eight stemness factors repressed by ciglitazone in both DB29- and T98G-BTSCs is DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B). The DNMT3B has been shown to be elevated in glioma patients compared with normal brain (Kreth et al, 2011). Similarly, growth differentiation factor 3 (GDF3) is another stemness gene repressed by ciglitazone in both DB29- and T98G-BTSCs. This is significant, because an earlier study showed that GDF3 induces the progression of melanoma in mice (Kreth et al, 2011), suggesting that the repression of GDF3 may contribute to the inhibition of BTSC growth by PPARg agonists. An earlier report also showed that FGF5 is important in the progression of malignant glioma (Allerstorfer et al, 2008). In this study, we found that ciglitazone inhibits FGF5 expression in both DB29- and T98G-BTSCs, suggesting its contribution to the regulation of BTSCs by PPARg agonists.
Among the 90 genes examined in this study, we focused on the altered expression of Sox2 and Nanog by PPARg agonists in BTSCs. The Sox2 is a key member of the Sox (SRY-like HMG box) family of transcription factors and is essential in maintaining ESC pluripotency (Bowles et al, 2000; Schepers et al, 2002). Along with Oct3/4, Sox2 regulates transcription of development-related genes and its own transcription via both positive and negative feedback mechanisms (Rizzino, 2009). It has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including pulmonary, oesophageal, gastric, breast, pancreatic, and rectal cancer (Li et al, 2004; Sanada et al, 2006; Rodriguez-Pinilla et al, 2007; Chen et al, 2008; Park et al, 2008; Sholl et al, 2010). It is also overexpressed in malignant glioma, whereas minimally expressed in normal tissues (Schmitz et al, 2007). Silencing of Sox2 expression in BTSCs resulted in reduced growth and tumourigenicity in animal models (Gangemi et al, 2009). Earlier studies have shown that a partial reduction or elevation in Sox2 expression can lead to ESC differentiation, suggesting existence of a complex regulatory mechanism (Chew et al, 2005). In this study, we found that PPARg agonists caused a slight upregulation of Sox2 at lower doses of PPARg agonists and an inhibition of Sox2 at higher doses in both T98G- and DB29-BTSCs, with an exception being DB29-BTSCs treated with 15d-PGJ2 that showed a reduction of Sox2 expression at all doses. A reduction of Sox2 expression observed in this study suggests that this could be a mechanism by which PPARg agonists regulate the growth and differentiation of BTSCs in glioblastoma.
Similarly, Nanog is a homeobox transcription factor that has a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of ESCs during development (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Takahashi et al, 2007; Yu et al, 2007). Interestingly, earlier studies have demonstrated the presence of Nanog in human glioma-derived BTSCs, suggesting its significance to the self-renewal of BTSCs in glioblastoma (Kappadakunnel et al, 2010). In this study, we found that PPARg agonists induce Nanog expression in both DB29- and T98G-BTSCs. In ESCs, overexpression of Sox2 can repress Nanog as well as itself through feedback inhibition (Rizzino, 2009). The direct link between Sox2 repression and Nanog upregulation by PPARg agonists in BTSCs is yet to be determined. However, the differential regulation of Sox2 and Nanog by PPARg agonists observed in this study suggests a critical role for these stemness factors in modulating growth and differentiation of BTSCs in glioma. Hence, our future studies will explore the mechanisms by which PPARg agonists regulate differentiation and self-renewal of BTSCs.
