[Abstract, Methods, Methods, Mixed]

A restricted cell population propagates glioblastoma growth following chemotherapy. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with a median survival of about one year1. This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence following surgical removal. Precisely how recurrence occurs is unknown. Using a genetically-engineered mouse model of glioma, we identify a subset of endogenous tumor cells that are the source of new tumor cells after the drug, temozolomide (TMZ), is administered to transiently arrest tumor growth. A Nestin-DTK-IRES-GFP (Nes-DTK-GFP) transgene that labels quiescent subventricular zone adult neural stem cells also labels a subset of endogenous glioma tumor cells. Upon arrest of tumor cell proliferation with TMZ, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate a tumor re-growth cell hierarchy originating with the Nes-DTK-GFP transgene subpopulation. Ablation of the GFP+ cells with chronic ganciclovir administration significantly arrested tumor growth and combined TMZ-ganciclovir treatment impeded tumor development. These data indicate the existence of a relatively quiescent subset of endogenous glioma cells that are responsible for sustaining long-term tumor growth through the production of transient populations of highly proliferative cells.

Methods Summary
Mice
All mice were maintained on a mixed 129SvJ/C57BL/6/B6CAB background. Mut7 and Mut7;Nes-DTK mice were obtained by crossing male hGFAP-Cre;P53flox/flox mice with female NF1flox/flox;P53flox/flox;Ptenflox/flox;Nes-DTK mice. Genotyping for Mut7 mice was performed as reported previously3.
In vivo chemical administration
Stock CldU (Sigma) and BrdU (Sigma) were dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 8.5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml, respectively. 11.5 mg/ml IdU (MP Biomedicals) solution was made fresh each time19. To label dividing cells, 5 ml/kg stock solution was injected intraperitoneally each time according to the experimental design. Ganciclovir (GCV) (Cytovene-IV, Roche Pharmaceuticals) treatment was performed as described5. For initial characterization of Nes-DTK-GFP mice, 1-month-old Nes-DTK-GFP or control mice were administered GCV (300 mg/kg/d) or PBS via osmotic minipump (Model 2002, 0.5 ml/h, Alzet) for 2 weeks. For treatment starting from 8 week or 10 weeks, 150 mg/kg/d GCV or PBS was delivered through osmotic minipump (Model 2004, 0.25 ml/h, Alzet); pumps were surgically removed and replaced every 4 weeks based on the experimental requirement. Temozolomide (TMZ) (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 82.5 mg/kg/d for five days. For the combinational therapy group, mice were first treated with TMZ for five days and then osmotic minipumps with GCV were implanted 2 days after the last TMZ injection.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Mice were perfused and brains were processed as described earlier2. Paraffin brain H&E sections (5 mm) were reviewed by J.C. and D.K.B independently. Tumor type and grades were determined by D.K.B. 14 mm cryostat sections were used for GFP/CldU/IdU staining following reported methods19. Primary antibodies were used against GFAP (DAKO, 1:2000), Olig2 (Millipore, 1:1000), Sox2 (Millipore, 1:5000), Nestin (BD Biosciences, 1:200), CD44 (BD Biosciences, 1: 75), GFP (Rockland, 1:200, Aves Lab, 1:500), BrdU/IDU (BD Biosciences, 1:100), BrdU/CldU (AbD Serotec,1:500), Ki67 (Novacastra, 1:1000), PDGFRa (Santa Cruz, 1:200). Horseradish peroxidase-based Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories) or Cy2/Alexa-488, C3/Alexa555, Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Labs, Invitrogen) were used to visualize the primary antibody staining.

Methods
Mice
All mouse experiments were approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. All mice were maintained on a mixed 129SvJ/C57BL/6/B6CAB background. Mut7 and Mut7;Nes-DTK mice were obtained by crossing male hGFAP-Cre;P53flox/flox mice with female NF1flox/flox;P53flox/flox;Ptenflox/flox;Nes-DTK mice.

Temozolomide, BrdU analogs, and pulse chase experiments
To determine TMZ efficiency, 10- to 11-week-old Mut7 mice were first injected intraperitoneally with 82.5 mg/kg/d TMZ for 5 days. 50 mg/kg BrdU was injected 2 hours after the final TMZ administration and mice were perfused 2 hours after BrdU injection. The brain was then paraffin-processed and cut into 5 mm-thick slices. H&E staining was performed every 70 mms to identify tumor location. Adjacent tumor sections were selected for GFAP and BrdU co-immunostaining.
For the short term CldU chase experiments, 10- to 11-week-old Mut7;Nes-DTK mice were first treated with TMZ for 5 days. A total of three doses of CldU were injected, with 2-hour intervals, the day after the final TMZ injection. A single dose of IdU was then injected 3 days after the final TMZ injection. For the long term CldU chase experiments, 10- to 11-week-old Mut7;Nes-DTK mice were first treated with TMZ for 5 days. CldU was injected 3 times a day, with 2-hour intervals, for 3 days after the final TMZ injection. A single dose of IdU was then injected 7 days after the final TMZ injection. Mice were perfused 2 hours after the IdU injection and the brains cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT, and cut into 14 mm-thick frozen sections. GFAP and Ki67 co-immunostaining was performed every 140 mms to locate the tumor area. Adjacent sections were selected for GFP/CldU/IdU triple immuno-fluorescence staining.
Quantification
Because of the heterogeneous nature of the tumors, cell density, Ki67-index and BrdU-positive cell percentage were quantified using the highest staining area1. Briefly, staining was checked under low-magnification and the highest staining area was identified. The area was viewed at 200X in three continuous 5mm-thick sections and positive cells counted using the measured parameters.
For quantification of GFP/CldU/IdU triple staining, tumor areas with at least one CldU-positive cell were selected, and an 8 mm Z-stack image was scanned and constructed using confocal microscopy (Olympus and Carl Zeiss). A total of ten different areas within each tumor was imaged and subjected to quantification.
