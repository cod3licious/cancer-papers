Protein kinase D2 regulates migration and invasion of U87MG glioblastoma cells in vitro. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor, which, despite combined modality treatment, reoccurs and is invariably fatal for affected patients. Recently, a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase D (PRKD) family, PRKD2, was shown to be a potent mediator of glioblastoma growth. Here we studied the role of PRKD2 in U87MG glioblastoma cell migration and invasion in response to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an activator of PRKD2 and a GBM mitogen. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated that random cell migration was significantly diminished in response to PRKD2 silencing. The pharmacological PRKD family inhibitor CRT0066101 decreased chemotactic migration and invasion across uncoated or matrigel-coated Transwell inserts. Silencing of PRKD2 attenuated migration and invasion of U87MG cells even more effectively. In terms of downstream signaling, CRT0066101 prevented PRKD2 autophosphorylation and inhibited p44/42 MAPK and to a smaller extent p54/46 JNK and p38 MAPK activation. PRKD2 silencing impaired activation of p44/42 MAPK and p54/46 JNK, downregulated nuclear c-Jun protein levels and decreased c-JunS73 phosphorylation without affecting the NFkB pathway. Finally, qPCR array analyses revealed that silencing of PRKD2 downregulates mRNA levels of integrin alpha-2 and -4 (ITGA2 and -4), plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU), plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (PLAUR), and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1). Findings of the present study identify PRKD2 as a potential target to interfere with glioblastoma cell migration and invasion, two major determinants contributing to recurrence of glioblastoma after multimodality treatment.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; astrocytoma WHO grade IV) is the most common and malignant type of primary brain tumors. GBM is characterized by high proliferative rate, aggressive invasiveness and insensitivity to radio- and chemo-therapy. The median survival in patients with newly diagnosed GBM following treatment with surgery, radio- and chemo-therapy is approximately 15 months [1]. Comprehensive genetic analyses of GBMs identified a number of mutations affecting three major pathways: the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway and its downstream oncogenic signaling by PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK, the p53, and the retinoblastoma protein pathway [2,3]. Modifications of these pathways drive gliomagenesis by mediating proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, survival, and deregulation of apoptotic signaling.
Three major reasons account for therapy resistance: the presence of the blood-brain barrier that restricts drug distribution to the brain, the heterogeneity of the tumor that consists of cell populations with different drug sensitivities, and the propensity of the tumor cells to infiltrate the normal brain leading to recurrences [4]. Individual cells or groups of cells can detach from the primary tumor and migrate to distant sites within normal brain structures [5]. The invasive nature of GBM has been frequently implicated as a key feature of resistance to therapy [6]. GBM cell invasion is a multistep, but highly coordinated process that starts with the degradation of surrounding matrix proteins by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [7]. Cells must then detach from their neighboring cells and matrix components in order to gain motility and move through healthy brain tissue. During this process cells must form new and release 'old' focal adhesions and constantly reorganize their cytoskeleton. This process is receptor mediated and involves complex interactions between integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases and (lipid-mediated) activation of downstream signaling cascades [7].
A core-signaling pathway in migration and invasion is the phospholipase C pathway catalyzing the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) leading to activation of the PKC family [8]. One of the targets activated by DAG and different PKC isoforms is the protein kinase D (PRKD) family [9]. The PRKD family is located downstream of PKC and belongs to the calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase superfamily and comprises of three isoforms PRKD-1, -2, and -3. Being major players in cell proliferation, motility, and angiogenesis, PRKD members received considerable interest as potential anti-cancer targets. Although the evidence for PRKD1 in tumor development is somewhat ambiguous (for review see [10]), PRKD1 is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [11,12] and pharmacological inhibition of PRKD1 was shown to impair pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma proliferation [13]. Both, PRKD1 and PRKD3 are involved in the progression and invasion of prostate cancer [14,15]. PRKD2 mediates NFkB activation in leukemia cells [16] and expression levels correlate with the state of de-differentiation in malignant human lymphoma [17]. Only recently it was demonstrated that PRKD2 is a potent regulator of glioblastoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo [18].
There is ample evidence that PRKD members are regulators of cell migration and invasion. PRKD1 controls fibroblast motility by modulating membrane traffic from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane [19]. PRKD1 is also involved in integrin transport to focal adhesions, thereby affecting cell migration [20]. PRKD members phosphorylate downstream targets that are involved in cell motility including cortactin [21], slingshot 1 like [22], and Par-1 [23]. PRKD1 regulates MMP expression in breast cancer cells [24] that control cell migration and invasion and play an important role in glioblastoma cell invasion [25]. PRKD signaling starts with ligand binding to seven-transmembrane or tyrosine kinase receptors that activate PLCb or PLCg. Activation of this pathway results in the generation of DAG and IP3. Membrane-associated DAG binds and activates PKC, which then phosphorylates two serine residues in the activation loop of PRKDs [9]. One of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands that activate PRKD is sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid that signals via five cognate G protein-coupled receptors termed S1P1-5
[26]. Exogenously added S1P is a potent glioblastoma mitogen and enhances glioblastoma invasiveness [27-31]. Accumulating evidence suggests that S1P is involved in cancer progression including cell transformation, cell survival, cell migration and metastasis, and neoangiogenesis of the tumor microenvironment [26]. In particular PRKD2 that is highly expressed in glioblastoma [18], has critical roles in vascular biology and angiogenesis [32]. PRKD2 mediates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration and regulates the expression of VEGF receptor-2 and the production of cytokines in ECs [33]. Furthermore, PRKD2 controls hypoxia-induced VEGF synthesis and secretion by tumor cells and regulates VEGF signaling in tumor-associated endothelial cells [34]. In addition, strong PRKD2 expression in the tumor endothelium of microvascular proliferations in glioblastoma was reported [18]. Only recently a splice variant of human calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 was identified as a novel PRKD2 substrate and interactor that contributes to tumor growth in vivo by promoting angiogenesis [35].
In the present study we tested the hypothesis that PRKD2 regulates U87MG glioblastoma cell migration and invasion. Pharmacological inhibition and PRKD2 silencing impaired migratory, chemotactic, and invasive behavior of non-stimulated and S1P-stimulated U87MG cells and attenuated activation of MAPK pathways. Gene expression analysis by RT profiler PCR arrays revealed altered expression levels of several genes involved in GBM motility and migration.

PRKD2 and MAPK activation
Prior to measurement of PRKD2 or MAPK activation, U87MG cells were serum-starved for 3 h. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of S1P for the indicated times and concentrations. Where specified, cells were incubated with CRT0066101 over night before S1P treatment. After incubation cells were lysed and protein extracts were collected.
Western blot analysis

Immunoreactive bands were visualized with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG and the ECL detection system. Quantification of protein expression (relative optical density) was normalized to appropriate loading controls (lamin A/C, actin, GAPDH) and phosphorylation of MAPKs was referred to total MAPK protein.

For data analyses the web-based software package provided by SABiosiences was used. Raw data were normalized to the most stably expressed housekeeping gene (ribosomal protein L13a) and fold-changes in gene expression were calculated using the DCt method. Genes with at least 1.8 fold expression changes compared to mock transfected cells were considered for further analyses by qPCR.
qPCR
Cells were transfected with specific siRNAs, lysed and RNA extracts were collected two or four days post transfection. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit. Aliquots of 3 ug of total RNA were reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase and random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Real-time PCRs were performed with an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System, the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR kit and QuantiTect Primer Assays. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT) was used as housekeeping gene. The following QuantiTect primer assays were used: Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Hs_HPRT_1_SG; internal standard), Protein Kinase D2 (Hs_PRKD2_1_SG), Integrin alpha 2 (Hs_ITGA2_1_SG), Integrin alpha 4 (Hs_ITGA4_1_SG), Plasminogen activator, urokinase (Hs_PLAU_1_SG), Plasminogen activator, urokinase receptor (Hs_PLAUR_1_SG), Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Hs_MMP1_1_SG).

Results
PRKD2 silencing inhibits migration and invasion of U87MG glioma cells in response to S1P
Initially we determined the efficacy of PRKD2 (Gene ID: 25865) silencing in U87MG cells using two different 21mer siRNA constructs. As shown in Fig. 1A, PRKD2 silencing led to reduced mRNA expression. Maximum knockdown was reached at day 2 with relative mRNA expression levels of 0.28 for siPRKD2_5 and 0.12 for siPRKD2_6. On protein level, expression was efficiently decreased by 95% up to day four with both siRNAs. A scrambled control siRNA had no effect on PRKD2 protein expression (Fig. 1B).
Next, we examined the effect of PRKD2 silencing on random 2D migration of U87MG cells by time-lapse video microscopy. By analyzing the tracks of 50 individual cells per group the velocity, accumulated distance, and Euclidian distance was calculated. The directionality of cell movement was determined as the Euclidian distance divided by the accumulated distance. As shown in Fig. 2A, silencing of PRKD2 resulted in a small, but statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction of migration speed as compared to cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (0.38 vs. 0.42 um/h; siPRKD2_5 vs. siSCR). Both, accumulated (540 vs. 630 um; siPRKD2 vs. siSCR) and Euclidian (125 vs. 195 um; siPRKD2 vs. siSCR) distance was significantly reduced in response to RNAi (Fig. 2B and C). In addition, the directionality of cell movement was attenuated in PRKD2 silenced cells (0.23 vs. 0.31; siPRKD2 vs. siSCR).
To determine the impact of pharmacological inhibition (using the PRKD family inhibitor CRT0066101) or PRKD2 silencing on chemotactic migration, Transwell inserts were used. Directed migration was analyzed in medium containing FCS (10% or 0.5%) or S1P (1 uM complexed to BSA) in the lower chamber. Representative micrographs of transmigrated cells are shown in Fig. 3A. These microscopic pictures indicate that both, pharmacological inhibition and RNAi of PRKD2 attenuates cell migration across uncoated Transwell inserts. Quantitative evaluation of these experiments showed that a reduction of FCS from 10% to 0.5% reduced the number of migrated non-transfected cells by 80% (220 vs. 45 cells/field). The addition of S1P to the lower chamber increased the migration by 2-fold in comparison to 0.5% FCS (Fig. 3B).
CRT0066101 reduced transmigration in 10% FCS by 24% (167 vs. 220 cells/field) and in response to S1P by 23% (71 vs. 92 cells/field). Under unphysiological, serum free conditions migration in the presence of CRT0066101 was increased by 2.1-fold. Transfection with siSCR yielded essentially the same results as observed with non-transfected cells. In contrast, chemotactic migration was significantly attenuated in PRKD2 silenced cells under all experimental conditions applied. Compared to siSCR, PRKD2 silencing impaired chemotactic migration by 51, 30 and 45% (10% or 0.5% FCS, and 1 uM S1P, respectively; Fig. 3B).
We further assessed the impact of CRT0066101 and PRKD2 silencing on invasive properties of U87MG cells in matrigel-coated Transwell inserts. Under control conditions a reduction of FCS from 10% to 0.5% in the lower chamber completely abrogated cell invasion while in the presence of S1P 3 (1 uM) and 10 cells (2.5 uM) invaded per field (Fig. 3C). CRT0066101 inhibited invasion by 49% and 60% (10% FCS and 2.5 uM S1P, respectively). As shown for chemotactic migration, CRT0066101 increased invasion under serum free conditions (0 vs. 12 cells/field). Transfection with siSCR slightly diminished (6.6%) invasion. Silencing of PRKD2 significantly reduced the number of transmigrated cells by 69 (10% FCS), 95 (1 uM S1P) and 78% (2.5 uM S1P; Fig. 3C) in comparison to siSCR.
Exogenous S1P induces activation of PRKD2 and MAPK pathways
PRKD family members are activated in response to extracellular stimuli, including S1P, thereby affecting various downstream signaling cascades implicated in tumor biology [10]. Thus, we first analyzed activation of PRKD2 and MAPK family members in response to S1P. As shown in Fig. 4 the addition of exogenous, BSA-complexed S1P resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent activation of PRKD2, p44/42 MAPK, p54/46 JNK and p38 MAPK. Autophosphorylation levels of PRKD2 at S876 were continuously increasing in response to S1P (1 nM to 10 uM). Activation of the MAPK family members occurred at comparable S1P levels (10-100 nM) as observed for PRKD2 (Fig. 4A). Stimulation with S1P for increasing times revealed maximal activation of PRKD2 after 5 min decreasing to baseline after 60 min. Time-dependent activation of p44/42 and p38 MAPKs followed comparable kinetics as observed for PRKD2 (Fig. 4B). p54/46 JNK activation reached its maximum at later time points (15 and 30 min) and was still elevated at 60 min.
Pharmacological inhibition and silencing of PRKD2 attenuates downstream MAPK pathways
In the next set of experiments the outcome of CRT0066101 and PRKD2 silencing on S1P-mediated activation of MAPK family members was studied. CRT0066101 (0.35 and 1 uM) attenuated basal and S1P-induced autophosphorylation of PRKD2, p44/42 MAPK and to a lesser extent p54/46 JNK and p38 MAPK (Fig. 5A). PRKD2 silencing significantly diminished phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and p54/46 JNK under basal or S1P-stimulated conditions (Fig. 5B), whereas phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was slightly impaired by scrambled siRNA. Neither CRT0066101 nor RNAi affected the levels of non-phosphorylated p54/46 JNK, p44/42, and p38 MAPKs. Thus, pharmacological inhibition and silencing of PRKD2 resulted in downregulation of signaling cascades that are implicated in glioblastoma migration and invasion.
JNK and ERK direct distinct cellular activities even though they share a number of common substrates, including several transcription factors. In PC12 cells activation of the ERK pathway results in stimulation of both c-Jun synthesis and c-Jun phosphorylation, whereas the JNK pathway triggers phosphorylation [37]. Western blot analysis of nuclear cell extracts (c-Jun was undetectable in the cytosolic fraction, data not shown) demonstrated that PRKD2 silencing attenuates the level of total c-Jun protein under basal and S1P stimulated conditions (Fig. 5C). Analysis of phosphorylated c-Jun revealed that PRKD2 silencing was without effects on c-JunS63 but slightly downregulates c-JunS73 phosphorylation under basal and S1P stimulated conditions (Fig. 5C).
In prostate cancer cells PRKD-2 and -3 were shown to promote cell invasion via the NFkB pathway [15]. To investigate whether this pathway is affected by PRKD2 silencing in U87MG cells we have analyzed NFkB levels in cytosolic and nuclear fractions of unstimulated and S1P-stimulated cells. Data shown in Fig. 5D demonstrate that PRKD2 silencing was without effect on protein levels of the NFkB-associated subunits p65 and p50 in U87MG cells.
PRKD2 silencing in U87MG cells affects mRNA expression levels of genes involved in glioma migration and invasion
To get an indication about downstream targets of PRKD2 under basal conditions, pathway analysis by qPCR array analysis was performed. Out of 28 genes involved in adhesion, invasion and metastasis, 5 genes (ITGA2, ITGA4, MMP1, PLAU, and PLAUR) exhibited at least a 1.8-fold change in mRNA expression levels in response to PRKD2 silencing compared to mock transfected cells (Table 1). Altered expression levels of these five products were confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 6). The relative mRNA expression levels of ITGA2, ITGA4, PLAU, and PLAUR after transfection with siPRKD2_5 were reduced up to 0.36, 0.61, 0.53, and 0.70, respectively. The most prominent effect of PRKD2 silencing was seen for the expression of MMP-1 with a maximum decrease of mRNA levels to 0.22 on day 2. At day 4 post silencing most of these effects were reduced, with exception of PLAU, which was upregulated 1.9-fold.

Discussion
The acquisition of cell motility is a key property of glioblastoma cells contributing to the dismal perspectives for affected patients. Work presented here identifies a S1P/PRKD2/MAPK signaling pathway that contributes to GBM cell migration and invasion. Our results show that S1P activates PRKD2 and induces a migrational and invasive response, which is attenuated in response to PRKD2 silencing (Figs. 2-4). Accumulating evidence suggests that S1P and S1P receptors are regulators of GBM growth, migration, and invasion via outside-in or inside-out signaling [38]. S1P signal transduction is mediated via five G protein-coupled receptors (S1P1-5) [26]. Of these, S1P1-3 and S1P5 are expressed in glioblastoma cell lines and tissue [39,40]. S1P1-3 couple to the PLC/PKC pathway (via Gi and Gq) and are therefore candidates that are able to induce PRKD2 activation as observed during the present study (Fig. 4). Exogenously added S1P enhances glioblastoma invasiveness [30,31] and microarray analyses have shown that upregulation of proteases by S1P could contribute to invasive properties of GBM cells [41]. S1P directly regulates uPAR expression in GBM cells thereby increasing invasiveness [31].
During carcinogenesis alterations in cell morphology and gene expression and the disruption of cell-cell adhesions promote cellular motility and invasiveness [42]. We show that PRKD2 silencing resulted in decreased motility and invasiveness of U87MG cells (Fig. 3), which in principle can be a direct effect and/or result from signaling events downstream of PRKD2. Along this line we provide evidence that pharmacological inhibition (CRT0066101; a small molecule inhibitor of the PRKD family that blocks pancreatic cancer; Ref. [13]) or silencing of PRKD2 results in impaired activation of MAPK pathways (Fig. 5A, B). This is in agreement with other reports demonstrating MAPK activation in a PRKD-dependent manner [43-45] mediating pro-proliferative properties as specifically reported for PRKD2 in glioblastoma [18]. However, MAPK signaling is also centrally involved in several other steps of tumor development. Phorbolester-mediated activation of the p44/42 MAPK pathway was shown to induce migration and invasion of GBM cell [46]. p44/42 MAPK is essential for integrin expression [47] and p44/42-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase, calpain, focal adhesion kinase, or paxillin promotes cancer cell migration (for review see Ref. [48]). p44/42 MAPK activation positively regulates uPAR expression [49], induces the expression of MMP-1 [25], and enhances 3D invasion of pancreatic cancer cells via MMP-1 expression [50]. Thus, decreased p44/42 MAPK signaling as observed here in response to PRKD2 silencing is compatible with altered gene expression patterns as described below.
The second MAPK pathway that was attenuated in response to CRT0066101 and PRKD2 silencing during the present study is the p54/46 JNK pathway (Fig. 5A, B). JNK signaling plays a pivotal role in GBM invasion as pharmacological inhibition reduces invasive properties [51]. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of the JNK pathway in vivo depletes self-renewing and tumor-initiating glioblastoma stem cell population [52,53]. Such a targeted pharmacological approach could eliminate tumor initiating GBM cells that infiltrate deep into unresectable brain regions. In this context it is noteworthy that PRKD2 was identified in the phosphoproteome of EGF-activated human glioblastoma-initiating cells [54]. These findings make it tempting to speculate that PRKD2 not only plays a role in primary GBM [18] but also could contribute to tumor recurrence via GBM-initiating cells.
The c-Jun protein, a member of the AP-1 transcription factor family, activates several events required for tumor progression. In general, AP-1 proteins demand MAPK-derived phosphorylation to form transcriptionally active complexes. External stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines and cell stress, can cause a MAPK-dependent increase in c-Jun transcription as shown for p44/42 MAPK [37], p54/46 JNK [55], and p38 MAPK [56]. In addition to transcriptional activation, MAPK-induced phosphorylation contributes to the stability of c-Jun protein. Phosphorylation by JNK enhances protein stability via protection from ubiquitination [57], whereas constitutively active p44/42 MAPK increases c-Jun stability via inactivation of glycogen kinase 2 in melanoma cells [58]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that sustained decrease of p44/42 MAPK and/or p54/46 JNK activation is (at least in part) responsible for decreased c-Jun levels as observed during the present study (Fig. 5C). Additionally, direct phosphorylation of c-Jun by PRKD2 may contribute to c-Jun regulation [59]. Of note, c-Jun accumulation is elevated in human glioblastoma and the migration and invasion capacity of U87MG cells is significantly reduced in response to c-Jun silencing [60]. In addition, c-Jun, as a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, regulates the expression of integrins [61], urokinase plasminogen activator receptor [62], and matrix metalloproteinases [63] that facilitate growth, invasion, and metastasis of GBM cells.
Array and qPCR analyses performed during the present study identified reduced expression levels of ITGA-2 and -4 (which encode integrin alpha2 and -alpha4, respectively) in response to PRKD2 silencing (Table 1, Fig. 6). The integrin family of cell adhesion receptors regulates a diverse array of cellular functions crucial to carcinogenesis [64] and mediates resistance towards radio- [65] and chemotherapy [66]. The importance of integrins in several cell types that affect tumor progression has made them an appealing target for cancer therapy including glioblastoma [67]. Results of a cilengitide phase II trial in patients with recurrent glioblastoma showed promising effects [68]. Of note, a splice variant of human calcium and integrin-binding protein 1a (CIB1a) was identified as a PRKD2 substrate that regulates tumor growth in vivo by promoting angiogenesis [35]. In light of the different signaling cascades that are elicited by PRKD2 the authors of that study suggested that targeting of PRKD2 phosphorylation substrates might be more specific than targeting the kinase itself [35].
Two other genes, namely PLAU (encoding urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPA) and PLAUR (encoding uPA receptor; uPAR) were also downregulated after PRKD2 silencing. uPAR is frequently expressed at high levels in GBM [69] and promotes cancer invasion by uPA binding and activation of extracellular proteases [70]. Silencing of uPA and/or uPAR was shown to inhibit invasion of GBM cells and xenografts [71]. Attenuation of PRKD2 expression by RNAi during the present study also reduced MMP-1 expression, a matrix metalloproteinase, which is expressed in GBM but absent in normal brain or low grade astrocytomas [72]. Of note, MMP-1 expression has a pronounced negative impact on median patient survival times [72]. A recent report has shown that silencing of PRKD2 and PRKD3 downregulates uPA, uPAR and MMP-9 and decreases the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells [15], findings compatible with data reported during the present study. However, in contrast to Zou et al. [15], who have identified PRKD2 as a major regulator of the pIKK-IkB-p65 nuclear translocation pathway that controls prostate cancer invasiveness, this pathway was unaffected in our study (Fig. 5D).
Recently, Navarro and colleagues investigated T-cell function in PRKD2 null mice or mice expressing catalytically inactive PRKD2 [73]. These studies revealed that loss of PRKD2 increases thymic output resulting in lymphoid hyperplasia and splenomegaly indicating a role for the kinase in thymic homeostasis [73]. Whether and to what extent pharmacological inhibition of PRKD2 in glioblastoma models would interfere with a normal T-cell response and lead to altered properties of tumor-associated immune cells remains to be established. Ideally this issue should be tested with a blood-brain barrier permeable inhibitor of PRKD2 in a preclinical intracranial animal model of GBM.
Overall, data presented here identify PRKD2 as a potential kinase target to reduce glioblastoma cell motility and invasion, two key properties fostering dissemination and recurrence of GBM. Gene expression analyses point towards a beneficial effect of PRKD2 silencing leading to the formation of a less motile and less invasive cellular GBM phenotype.
