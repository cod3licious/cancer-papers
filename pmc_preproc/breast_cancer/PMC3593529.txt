[Abstract, Methods, Results]

Bay11-7082 inhibits the disintegration of the lymphendothelial barrier triggered by MCF-7 breast cancer spheroids; the role of ICAM-1 and adhesion. Background: Many cancers spread through lymphatic routes, and mechanistic insights of tumour intravasation into the lymphatic vasculature and targets for intervention are limited. The major emphasis of research focuses currently on the molecular biology of tumour cells, while still little is known regarding the contribution of lymphatics.   Methods: Breast cancer cell spheroids attached to lymphendothelial cell (LEC) monolayers were used to investigate the process of intravasation by measuring the areas of 'circular chemorepellent-induced defects' (CCID), which can be considered as entry gates for bulky tumour intravasation. Aspects of tumour cell intravasation were furthermore studied by adhesion assay, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Replacing cancer spheroids with the CCID-triggering compound 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) facilitated western blot analyses of Bay11-7082- and baicalein-treated LECs.   Results: Binding of LECs to MCF-7 spheroids, which is a prerequisite for CCID formation, was mediated by ICAM-1 expression, and this depended on NF-kB and correlated with the expression of the prometastatic factor S100A4. Simultaneous inhibition of NF-kB with Bay11-7082 and of arachidonate lipoxygenase (ALOX)-15 with baicalein prevented CCID formation additively.   Conclusion: Two mechanisms contribute to CCID formation: ALOX15 via the generation of 12(S)-HETE by MCF-7 cells, which induces directional migration of LECs, and ICAM-1 in LECs under control of NF-kB, which facilitates adhesion of MCF-7 cells to LECs.

Monoclonal mouse anti-CD31 (JC70A) as well as anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark).
Cell culture
Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA), and grown in MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen; Karlsruhe, Germany). Telomerase immortalised human LECs were grown in EGM2 MV (Clonetics CC-4147; Allendale, NJ, USA), all at 37 degC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For CCID formation assays, LECs were stained with cytotracker green purchased from Invitrogen.
3D co-cultivation of breast cancer spheroids with LEC monolayers
MCF-7 cells were transferred to 30 ml MEM medium containing 6 ml of 1.6% methylcellulose solution (0.3% final concentration; cat. no.: M-512, 4000 centipoises; Sigma-Aldrich). 150 ml of this cell suspension were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate (Cellstar 650185, Greiner Bio-One; Kremsmunster, Austria) to allow spheroid formation within 48 h. Then, MCF-7 spheroids were washed in PBS and transferred to cytotracker-stained LEC monolayers that were seeded into 24-well plates (Costar 3524, Sigma-Aldrich) in 2 ml EGM2 MV medium.
CCID assay
MCF-7 cell spheroids (3000 cells per spheroid) were transferred to 24-well plates containing LEC monolayers. After 4 h of incubation, the CCID areas in the LEC monolayers underneath the MCF-7 spheroids were photographed using an Axiovert (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) fluorescence microscope to visualise cytotracker (green)-stained LECs underneath the spheroids. CCID areas were calculated with the Axiovision Re. 4.5 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). MCF-7 spheroids were treated with solvent (DMSO) as a negative control. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and for each condition, the CCID size of 12 or more spheroids (unless otherwise specified) was measured.
Western blotting
LECs were seeded in 6 cm dishes and treated with the indicated compounds (10 m Bay11-7082 and or 1 m 12(S)-HETE). Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton-X 100, 1 m phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and protease inhibitor cocktail. Afterwards, the lysate was centrifuged at 12 000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 degC, and the supernatant stored at -20 degC until further analysis. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electro-transferred onto Hybond PVDF-membranes (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 degC. To control equal sample loading, membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with PBS/Tween 20 (pH 7.2) or Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween 20 (pH 7.6), membranes were immersed in blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween, or in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were washed and incubated with primary antibodies (in blocking solution; dilution 1 : 500-1 : 1000) by gently rocking at 4 degC overnight or at room temperature for 1 h. Thereafter, the membranes were washed with PBS/Tween or TBE/Tween and incubated with secondary antibodies (peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG; dilution 1 : 2000) at room temperature for 1 h. Chemiluminescence was detected by ECL detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Portsmouth, IL, USA), and the membranes were exposed to Amersham Hyperfilms (GE-Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Real-Time PCR
LECs were seeded in 12-well plates, then they were pretreated with 10 m Bay11-7082 for 30 min, and thereafter stimulated with 1.0 m 12(S)-HETE or with TNF-a (20 ng ml-1). Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit 50 and QIAshredder 50 (QIAGEN, Hamburg, Germany). An amount of 1.0 mg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen), the resulting cDNA was amplified using TaqMan Universal PCR Master mix (No AmpErase UNG; part no. 4324018; Applied Biosystems, Vienna, Austria) with the E-selectin Primer (TaqMan gene expression assays, part no. 4331182; Applied Biosystems). PCR products were analysed on the Abi Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Duplicate samples were analysed in parallel. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as internal control. Relative transcript expression was calculated using the DDCT method.
siRNA transfection
One day before transfection, LECs were seeded in a 48-well plate (250 ml per well) and grown in EGM 2 MV medium. On the day of transfection the cells had a confluence of 70%. First, all siRNAs (siRNA ID#: s7086, siRNA ID#: s7087; cat. no.: 4392420) and siRNA negative scramble control (Ambion, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were re-suspended in nuclease-free water. Then 0.75 mg siRNAs were diluted in culture medium (containing serum and antibiotics) to a final volume of 50 ml. Then, the dilution was mixed briefly by vortexing and 3 ml of a 1 : 4 dilution of RNAiFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, cat. no. 301605) were added to the diluted siRNA. Thereafter the dilution was mixed by vortexing for 10 s and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cell culture medium was aspirated from the plate and 300 ml of fresh medium (containing serum and antibiotics) were added per well. Then the mix was added drop-wise to the cells and incubated for 8 h at 37 degC. After 8 h the medium was changed and the cells were incubated for 48 h to recover.
Adhesion assay
MCF-7 cells (15 000 per well) were seeded in serum-free medium (DMEM containing 0.5% BSA, 2 mM CaCl2 and 2 mM MgCl2). Then 500 x cytotracker (500 x CytoTracker Solution from CytoSelect tumour-endothelium adhesion assay from Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, cat. no. CBA-215) was added to the cell suspension (2 ml CytoTracker to 1 ml suspension), incubated for 1 h at 37 degC and centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m. for 2 min. Then the medium was aspirated, the cell pellet was washed 3 x with serum-free medium and then re-suspended in EGM2 MV medium. Meanwhile, the medium was aspirated from the endothelial cell culture (in wells of a 48-well plate), collected in Eppendorf tubes, and either Bay11-7082 (15 m) or DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. Then, the medium was re-distributed to LEC layers and incubated for 10 min. Also the MCF-7 cell suspension, which was stained with cytotracker, was treated with Bay11-7082 (15 m) or DMSO and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the medium was aspirated from the 48-well plate and 200 ml of treated MCF-7 cell suspension were added to each well containing LECs grown in monolayers and incubated for 40 min at 37 degC. Then the medium was aspirated from each well and washed 3 x with 250 ml 1 x wash buffer (10 x wash buffer was from CytoSelect tumour-endothelium adhesion assay). Before the third wash, cells were inspected for morphological changes under the microscope. Then the final wash was aspirated and the plate was tapped on a flint free paper towel. 150 ml of 1 x lysis buffer (4 x lysis buffer was from CytoSelect tumour-endothelium adehsion assay) was added to each well and lysed by the shearing forces through a pipette tip. An amount of 100 ml of the lysate were transferred to a 96-well clear bottom plate, and then the fluorescence was read with a fluorescence plate reader at 485/530 nm.
Statistical analysis
Dose-response curves were analysed using Prism 4 software (La Jolla, CA, USA), and significance was determined by Student's t-test. Significant differences between experimental groups were *P<0.05.

Results and Discussion

B-dependent expression of ICAM-1 contributes to CCID formation
Under physiological conditions, the ALOX12/15 metabolite 12(S)-HETE is mainly produced by platelets, leucocytes, smooth muscle, epithelium, neuron and fibroblast cells (Spector et al, 1988) and induces retraction of microvascular endothelial cells (Honn et al, 1994; Uchide et al, 2007). Under pathophysiological conditions, 12(S)-HETE increases tumour cell adhesion to exposed ECM (Honn et al, 1989). 12(S)-HETE is shed by MCF-7 spheroids (Uchide et al, 2007) and triggers directional LEC mobility and consequently CCID formation (Madlener et al, 2010; Kerjaschki et al, 2011; Vonach et al, 2011). As the deregulation of NF-kB is associated with cancer development (Folmer et al, 2009) promoting oncogenesis through the transcriptional activation of genes associated with cell proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis (Orlowski and Baldwin, 2002), we focussed on the role of NF-kB in CCID formation. The adhesion of MCF-7 spheroids to LEC monolayers is a prerequisite for CCID formation and increasing concentrations of Bay11-7082 caused the gradual loss of cell adhesion (Figure 1A). Treatment with 25 m Bay11-7082 completely prevented the attachment of MCF-7 spheroids to LECs and CCID formation (data not shown). Therefore, NF-kB-dependent expression of adhesion molecules could account for the stable contact of MCF-7 spheroids to LECs. CD31, E-selectin (SELE) and ICAM-1 are known to be expressed in endothelial cells. These molecules connect to other cell types through counter-receptors, that is, avb3 integrin (vitronectin receptor), CD44, and aLb2 integrin (LFA-1), respectively, which were all reported to be expressed in MCF-7 cells (Budinsky et al, 1997; Deryugina et al, 2000). 12(S)-HETE induced the expression of ICAM-1 and CD31 in LECs, whereas SELE was neither constitutively expressed in LECs nor induced by 12(S)-HETE (Figures 1B-D). As the induction of ICAM-1 (but not the induction of CD31) was inhibited by Bay11-7082, ICAM-1 may have contributed to NF-kB-dependent adhesion of MCF-7 spheroids to LEC monolayers. Specific inhibition of ICAM-1 expression in LECs by siRNAs (Figure 2A) affected the adhesion of MCF-7 cells to LECs, (Figure 2B) and also the formation of CCIDs was attenuated when ICAM-1 expression of LECs was specifically inhibited by siRNA (Figure 2C). Hence, adhesion mediated by ICAM-1 contributes to NF-kB-dependent CCIDs. As CCIDs are the consequence of directional migration of LECs (away from MCF-7 spheroids), mobility proteins were activated (Vonach et al, 2011). In 12(S)-HETE-stimulated LECs the treatment with Bay11-7082 inhibited the de-phosphorylation of Erk and the expression of S100A4, which is an angiogenic factor and a marker for a mesenchymal phenotype (Zeisberg and Neilson, 2009) inducing mesenchymal motility and invasiveness of endothelial cells (Takenaga et al, 1994; Ambartsumian et al, 2001; Jenkinson et al, 2004; Schmidt-Hansen et al, 2004). Thus, 12(S)-HETE induced a mobile, mesenchymal phenotype in LECs (Vonach et al, 2011), which was reversed by Bay11-7082. However, the activating phosphorylation of threonine-696 of MYPT was not prevented by Bay11-7082 (Figure 2D). Therefore, the activity of MYPT was independent of NF-kB and did not correlate with the expression of ICAM-1, indicating that also other mechanisms contributed to LEC plasticity.
Simultaneous inhibition of NF-
k
B- and ALOX activity additively reduces CCID formation
Consistent with the role of ALOX12/15 in the formation of CCIDs was the fact that the ALOX12/15 inhibitor baicalein (100 m), attenuated LEC-CCID formation by ~50% (Figure 3A). Simultaneous treatment with baicalein plus Bay11-7082 inhibited CCIDs additively. This inhibition was controlled in two ways:
By the CCID-inducing activity of ALOX15, which was restricted to MCF-7 cells because in 12(S)-HETE-stimulated LECs the expression of S100A4, and the phosphorylation patterns of Erk1/2, MYPT1 and MLC2 remained unchanged in presence of baicalein (Figure 3B). It was formerly shown that 12(S)-HETE treatment results in an enhanced phosphorylation of MLC (Rice et al, 1998; Vonach et al, 2011). Mobility is mediated in microvascular endothelial cells through enhanced phosphorylation (activation) of proteins, comigrating with MLC, actin and vimentin (Tang et al, 1993).By the CCID-inducing activity of NF-kB, which controlled the expression of ICAM-1 and adhesion of LECs to MCF-7 spheroids (Figures 1A and B). In contrast, baicalein, which is a major inhibitor of CCID formation, did not inhibit the expression of ICAM-1 and CD31 (Figure 3C). The inertia of LECs towards baicalein supported the notion that both CCID-inducing mechanisms were essentially independent of each other (with the exception that 12(S)-HETE induced Bay11-7082-sensitive S100A4 expression).
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NF-kB controls the adhesion of MCF-7 spheroids to LECs and the formation of CCIDs (Figure 4). The question arises whether alone the adherence of MCF-7 spheroids to LECs (i.e., through ICAM-1) triggers LEC migration or whether additional stimuli are required. It was shown that 12(S)-HETE stimulates NF-kB activation and NF-kB-dependent ICAM-1 expression through RhoA and PKCa (Bolick et al, 2005). This indicates that RhoA is an upstream regulator of ICAM-1, and Rho/Rac family GTPases are also prominent regulators of cell migration. Therefore, ICAM-1 expression and LEC motility are most likely parallel, but not serial events. The inhibition of 12(S)-HETE-triggered ICAM-1 expression by Bay11-7082, yet simultaneous persistence of MYPT activation, supported the hypothesis of parallel events.
Co-treatment of the 3D cell system with Bay11-7082 together with the ALOX12/15 inhibitor baicalein exhibited an additive effect on the prevention of CCID formation. These results underscore that several distinct mechanisms contribute to tumour intravasation, and may thus provide targets for interference with the metastatic process.
