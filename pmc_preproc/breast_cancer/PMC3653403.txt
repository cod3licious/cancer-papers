[Abstract, Methods, Mixed]

Genome-wide association analysis identifies three new breast cancer susceptibility loci. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. To date, 22 common breast cancer susceptibility loci have been identified accounting for ~ 8% of the heritability of the disease. We followed up 72 promising associations from two independent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in ~70,000 cases and ~68,000 controls from 41 case-control studies and nine breast cancer GWAS. We identified three new breast cancer risk loci on 12p11 (rs10771399; P=2.7 x 10-35), 12q24 (rs1292011; P=4.3x10-19) and 21q21 (rs2823093; P=1.1x10-12). SNP rs10771399 was associated with similar relative risks for both estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and ER-positive breast cancer, whereas the other two loci were associated only with ER-positive disease. Two of the loci lie in regions that contain strong plausible candidate genes: PTHLH (12p11) plays a crucial role in mammary gland development and the establishment of bone metastasis in breast cancer, while NRIP1 (21q21) encodes an ER co-factor and has a role in the regulation of breast cancer cell growth.

Methods
GWAS analysis
Primary genotype data were obtained for nine breast cancer GWAS in populations of European ancestry (Supplementary Table 6). Standard QC was performed on all scans, as follows. We excluded all individuals with low call rate (<95%), extreme high or low heterozygosity (P<10-5), and all individuals evaluated to be of non-European ancestry (>15% non-European component, by multidimensional scaling using the three Hapmap2 populations as a reference). We excluded SNPs with: call rate <95%; call rate <99% and MAF<5%, all SNPs with MAF<1%, and SNPs whose genotype frequencies departed from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at P<10-6 in controls or P<10-12 in cases. For highly significant SNPs the genotype intensity cluster plots were examined manually to judge reliability, either centrally or by contacting the original investigators.
Data were imputed for all scans for ~2.6M SNPs using HapMap version 2 CEU as a reference, using the program Mach v1.0. Estimated per-allele ORs and standard errors were generated from the imputed genotypes using Probabel69. For two studies (UK2 and HEBCS), estimates were adjusted by the first three principal components, since this was found to materially reduce the inflation. Residual inflation was then adjusted for by multiplying the variance by a genomic control adjustment factor, based on the ratio of the median chi-squared test statistic to its expected value. BBCS and UK2 used the same control data (WTCCC2) but different genotyping platforms. These studies were imputed separately. For the combined analysis, the control set was divided randomly between the two studies, in proportion to the size of case series, to provide disjoint strata. For a limited subset of SNPs that could not be imputed (including rs2532348 and rs199523 on 17q21), genotype data from the original scan(s) were used in the analysis.
Replication stage
SNPs for replication were genotyped in 46 studies, of which 4 were case-only studies that did not contribute to the current analysis (Supplementary Table 7). Data from BBCS were excluded as the same cases were included in the GWAS. Seven studies (HABCS, HMBCS, HUBCS, KARBAC, RBCS, SEARCH and SEBCS) were analysed by Fluidigm for 72 SNPs (Supplementary Table 2). We selected 63 SNPs selected from UK2: one replaced by a better surrogate, and one failed, so only data were available for 61 SNPs. Ten SNPs were selected from BBCS and one SNP was selected from both scans (The original SNP, rs1975930, also referred to as rs56003999, did not work by Fluidigm and in some iPlex analyses and was replaced by a surrogate rs10771399, r2=0.95, which was typed in all studies). Samples from 27 studies were genotyped by iPlex for 29 SNPs that showed the strongest associations. Seven additional studies (ABCFS, CGPS, MCCS, NC-BCFR, OFBCR, PBCS, UKBGS) were genotyped by Taqman for up to 4 SNPs that showed association after the Fluidigm and iPlex genotyping, including all three 3 SNPs discussed in detail here. We restricted the analysis to individuals of European or East Asian ancestry, since the sample size for other ethnicities was too small to give meaningful results.
All studies complied with BCAC genotyping QC standards by including at least 2% of samples in duplicate and a common set of 93 CEPH DNAs used by the HapMap Consortium (HAPMAPPT01, Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Cambden, NJ). Genotype data were excluded for: any sample that consistently failed genotyping for >20% of the SNPs typed; all samples on any one plate that had a SNP call rate <90%; all genotype data for any SNP where overall call rate was <95%; and all genotype data for any SNP where duplicate concordance was <98% (based on 2% of samples genotyped in duplicate). In addition, for any SNP for which the P-value for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for controls was <0.005, clustering of the intensity plots was reviewed manually and the data excluded if clustering was judged to be poor. After QC exclusions we analysed data on 54,588 cases of invasive breast cancer, 2,401 cases of DCIS and 58,098 controls.
Per-allele and genotype-specific odds ratios for the replication stage were estimated using logistic regression, adjusted for study. Women of European and Asian ancestry were analysed separately. NC-BCFR contributed cases and controls to both European and Asian analyses; for the remaining studies the subjects were either predominantly European or predominantly Asian, and subjects from other minority ethnicities were excluded.
Statistical significance levels from the GWAS and BCAC replication phases were obtained by combining the logOR estimates and standard errors as in a fixed effect meta-analysis. Heterogeneity in the OR association with each SNP by ER status was evaluated using a case-only analysis, by logistic regression. Heterogeneity by age was evaluated by fitting a linear age x genotype interaction term.
