O-GlcNAcylation-Inducing Treatments Inhibit Estrogen Receptor ?
Expression and Confer Resistance to 4-OH-Tamoxifen in Human Breast
Cancer-Derived MCF-7 Cells. O-GlcNAcylation (addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine on serine or threonine residues) is a post-translational modification that regulates stability, activity or localization of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. O-linked N-acetylgluocosmaine transferase (OGT) uses UDP-GlcNAc, produced in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to O-GlcNacylate proteins. Removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins is catalyzed by the b-N-Acetylglucosaminidase (OGA). Recent evidences suggest that O-GlcNAcylation may affect the growth of cancer cells. However, the consequences of O-GlcNAcylation on anti-cancer therapy have not been evaluated. In this work, we studied the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on tamoxifen-induced cell death in the breast cancer-derived MCF-7 cells. Treatments that increase O-GlcNAcylation (PUGNAc and/or glucosoamine) protected MCF-7 cells from death induced by tamoxifen. In contrast, inhibition of OGT expression by siRNA potentiated the effect of tamoxifen on cell death. Since the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway is a major regulator of cell survival, we used BRET to evaluate the effect of PUGNAc+glucosamine on PIP3 production. We observed that these treatments stimulated PIP3 production in MCF-7 cells. This effect was associated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation. However, the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, which abolished the effect of PUGNAc+glucosamine on Akt phosphorylation, did not impair the protective effects of PUGNAc+glucosamine against tamoxifen-induced cell death. These results suggest that the protective effects of O-GlcNAcylation are independent of the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway. As tamoxifen sensitivity depends on the estrogen receptor (ERa) expression level, we evaluated the effect of PUGNAc+glucosamine on the expression of this receptor. We observed that O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatment significantly reduced the expression of ERa mRNA and protein, suggesting a potential mechanism for the decreased tamoxifen sensitivity induced by these treatments. Therefore, our results suggest that inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation may constitute an interesting approach to improve the sensitivity of breast cancer to anti-estrogen therapy.

Introduction
Growth and proliferation of cancer cells tightly depend on their nutritional
environment, particularly on glucose availability, which is necessary for increased
biosynthesis of cellular components associated with proliferation (e.g. membranes,
proteins and nucleic acids) [1]. Nutritional
and metabolic conditions are known to influence tumour development. Excess food
intake associated with modern lifestyle constitutes an important cancer risk factor
[2]. In animals, food restriction has
inhibitory effects on the growth of certain tumours [3], whereas in diet-induced obesity models, overfeeding is associated
with accelerated development of tumours [4].
Nutritional conditions can modulate tumour development by modifying insulin and IGF-1
concentrations, which affect signalling pathways involved in cell growth,
proliferation and apoptosis. However, at the cellular level, glucose can also
directly regulate signalling pathways and multiple biological processes through
O-GlcNAc glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) of cytosolic and nuclear proteins [5]. O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible
post-translational modification, analogous to phosphorylation, which controls
protein localisation, stability or activity according to the nutritional
environment. It corresponds to the addition of N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on
serine or threonine residues. This reaction is catalysed by O-GlcNAc transferase
(OGT), which uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate (Figure 1). UDP-GlcNAc, produced through the
hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), can be considered as a sensor for the
nutritional state of the cell, as it integrates glucose, glutamine, fatty acids
(acetyl), uridine and ATP metabolism [5-9]. O-GlcNAc is rapidly removed from proteins by
O-GlcNAcase (OGA), permitting dynamic regulation of O-GlcNAcylation levels in
cells.

Figure 1
The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway controls O-GlcNAc-modification of
proteins.
Cytosolic and nuclear O-GlcNAc glycosylation constitutes a dynamic process
that regulates the activity, the localisation or the stability of the
modified proteins. O-GlcNAc glycosylation of proteins on serine and
threonine residues depends on the flux of glucose through the hexosamine
biosynthetic pathway (HBP). A fraction (2 to 5%) of the glucose entering the
cell is directed into this pathway for the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc. OGT
uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate to add GlcNAc on serine or threonine
residues, and its activity is tightly dependent on the concentration of
UDP-GlcNAc in the cell. These modifications can be reversed by O-GlcNAcase
(OGA), which removes the O-GlcNAc moiety from O-GlcNAc-modified proteins.
Experimentally, the level of O-GlcNAc in proteins can be increased by
incubating cells with glucosamine (which bypasses allosteric inhibition of
the rate limiting enzyme GFAT (Glutamine Fructose 6-P amidotransferase)), or
with PUGNAc (O-[2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene]
amino-N-phenylcarbamate), which inhibits deglycosylation by OGA.
A growing amount of studies indicates that O-GlcNAcylation constitutes an important
regulator of cancer growth and invasion. A number of transcription factors involved
in the control of cell proliferation or cell death can be regulated by O-GlcNAc
[10-15]. Moreover, increased protein O-GlcNAcylation has been detected in
cells derived from breast, lung, colon, liver and prostate cancers. These
modifications, often associated with changes in OGT and/or OGA levels [16-18],
favour the growth and/or migration of tumour cells through different mechanisms,
including regulation of transcription factors activity [19,20], E-cadherin
[18,21], and MMP metalloproteases [18,20].
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Endocrine therapies have permitted
important progress for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancers. However,
the development of treatment resistance constitutes an important limitation to these
therapies. Thus, tamoxifen, a partial antagonist of the estrogen receptor, has been
largely used for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancers, but
resistance to this drug often occurs [22].
The link between nutritional conditions, obesity and breast cancer is well
established, particularly in menopausal women [23]. However, few studies have evaluated the consequences of metabolic
manipulations on the efficiency of anti-cancer therapy. In this work, we studied the
effect of treatments that induce protein O-GlcNAcylation on the sensitivity to
tamoxifen, using the human breast cancer derived, estrogen receptor positive MCF-7
cell line.

Methods
Chemicals and antibodies
Glucosamine (GlcN) was from Sigma-Aldrich,
O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)-amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc)
from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., and LY294002 from Cell Signaling
Technology. Anti-Akt, anti-Phospho-Akt and anti-phospho-Erk1/2 antibodies were
from Cell Signaling Technology, anti-ERa (60C) from Millipore, anti-O-GlcNAc
(CTD 110.6) from Covance, anti-GAPDH from Life Technologies, anti-b-actin from
Sigma, anti-Erk2 (sc 154) and HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (sc 2305) from
Santa Cruz, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse from Jackson ImmunoResearch
laboratories.
Cell culture and transfection
MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Transfection of siRNA and cDNAs were performed with Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Life
Technologies) and FuGene 6 (Promega), respectively. The negative control siRNA
was from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium).
Uptiblue assay
Cells were plated in clear 96-well-plates at a density of 2000 cells/well. 24 h
after plating, cell population density was evaluated 2h30 after adding 10%
Uptiblue reagent, by measuring fluorescence (initial fluorescence) at 595 nm
using Typhoon 9400 imager (GE Healthcare). Cells were then cultured for 24 or 48
h in fresh media containing the different agents, and then the final
fluorescence was measured. The cell population growth in each well was expressed
as the ratio of the final fluorescence over the initial one in the same culture
well [24].
Apoptosis analysis
After treatment in 6-well-plates, cells were harvested by trypsin digestion,
washed in PBS and labelled with both Annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide using
the Annexin-V FLUOS kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to manufacturers'
instructions. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with the FC 500 cytometer
(Beckman Coulter).
BRET experiments
Luc-Akt-PH and YFP-Mem cDNAs used for the study of PIP3 production
have been previously described [25].
MCF-7 cells were transfected with 0.7 ug Luc-Akt-PH and 0.3 ug pYFP-Mem cDNAs
per 10.3 mm dish and transferred to a 96 well plate 24 h before BRET
experiments. BRET experiments were performed as described previously [26,27]. Results were expressed in milliBRET units as previously
described [28,29].
Luciferase assay
The ESR1-Luc reporter gene (firefly luciferase coding sequence
under the control of the P1 promoter of ESR1 gene [30], kindly provided by Dr. M. LE
ROMANCER-CHERIFI) was used. Cells were seeded in 12-well-plates and transfected
24 h later with 1 ug of ESR1-Luc plasmid combined with 2 ng of a Renilla
luciferase cDNA to normalize for transfection efficiency. After treatment, cells
were lysed and luciferase activities were measured with a Centro LB 910
luminometer (Berthold) using the DUAL Luciferase Assay kit (Promega).
Western-blotting
MCF-7 cells were lysed with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 137 mM NaCl,
10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) NP40, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM di-sodium
b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na 3VO4, 1 mM streptozotocin and
protease inhibitors (1ug/ml pepstatin, antipain, leupeptin, aprotinin and
AEBSF). Proteins were then analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by western-blotting
[31].
RNA extraction, Reverse Transcription and qPCR
After treatment, cells cultured in 6-well-plate were lysed directly in Trizol
reagent (Life Technologies) and RNA were isolated and reverse transcribed as
previously described [32]. Levels of the
cDNA of interest were measured by qPCR using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master
SYBR Green 1 kit. To ensure absence of genomic DNA contamination, RNA samples
were treated in parallel without Reverse Transcriptase and controlled for
absence of amplification by qPCR. The sequences of the primers used in these
experiments are: ESR1: Forward, GCATTCTACAGGCCAAATTCAG, Reverse, GTCGTTATGTCCTTG
AATACTTC; p21: Forward, TGTACCCTTGTGCCTCGCTCAG; Reverse, TGTA
CCCTTGTGCCTCGCTCAG; EGR1: Forward, GCACCTGACCGCAGAGTCTT, Reverse,
AGTGGTTTGGCTGGGGTAACT; Cyclophilin A: Forward, GGTGACTTC ACACGCCATAATG, Reverse,
ACAAGATGCCAGGACCCGTAT. Gene expression was normalized using cyclophilin A mRNA
level as a reference.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (GraphPad) using either a
t test or ANOVA followed by post-test as indicated in
figure legends.

Results
O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatments protect MCF-7 cells from
4OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death
We used the Uptiblue, which monitors the cellular growth within the same well, to
evaluate the effect of different treatments on MCF-7 cells [24]. Cells were treated with PUGNAc
(inhibitor of OGA) and glucosamine (bypasses the GFAT rate limiting step) in
absence or presence of 4-OH-Tamoxifen. Treatment with PUGNAc and glucosamine
(GlcN) markedly increase O-GlcNAcylation of proteins in MCF-7 cells, both in the
absence and presence of 4-OH-Tamoxifen (Figure S1).
Figure 2A shows that
treatment with PUGNAc and/or GlcN had no significant effect on cell growth.
4-OH-Tamoxifen markedly reduced the growth of the cell population after 24 h of
culture. Interestingly, the effect of 4-OH-Tamoxifen was partially reversed by
the presence of either PUGNAc or GlcN, and completely reversed when adding both
agents together. Similar results were observed after 48 h of culture with the
different agents (Figure
2B). These results suggest that treatment with PUGNAc and GlcN protects
MCF-7 cells form 4-OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death.

Figure 2

MCF-7 cells were cultured in presence of 1% FBS during 24 h (A) or 48 h
(B), in the absence or presence PUGNAc (100 uM), Glucosamine (GlcN, 5
mM) and 4-OH-tamoxifen (10 uM). The cell population growth in each well
was evaluated using an Uptiblue-based-assay as the ratio of final
fluorescence over the initial one (broken line) in the same well. Each
determination corresponds to measurements performed in triplicate wells.
Results are the mean+-SEM of at least 7 independent experiments.
Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Dunnet's
post-test. *, P< 0.05; **, P< 0.01 when compared to untreated
control; NS, not significant. (C) MCF-7 cells were cultured in presence
of 1% FBS during 24 h, in the absence or presence of PUGNAc+GlcN and
4-OH-tamoxifen (10 uM) and then analysed by FACS after Annexin
V-FITC/Propidium Iodide staining. Statistical analysis was performed
using ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test *, P< 0.05; **, P< 0.01.
Results correspond to the mean+-SEM of at least 4 independent
experiments.
We then studied more specifically the effects of 24h treatments on apoptosis
using FACS analysis, after labelling the cells with Annexin V-FITC and propidium
iodide. In absence of Tamoxifen, PUGNAc and GlcN had no significant effect on
cell apoptosis. Tamoxifen induced a 2-fold increase in apoptosis, which was
prevented by the presence of PUGNAc + GlcN (Figure 2C).
To confirm the involvement of O-GlcNAc modifications in protection from
4OH-tamoxifen-induced cell death, we used siRNA to study the effect of
inhibiting OGT expression on apoptosis. As shown in Figure 3A, the expression of OGT was
inhibited in siOGT-transfected cells compared to control (siNeg-transfected)
cells, which in turn resulted in a decrease in the level of O-GlcNAcylated
proteins. Figure 3B shows
that inhibition of OGT expression increased tamoxifen-induced cell death.
Altogether, these results indicate that increased O-GlcNAcylation protects MCF-7
cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of OGT sensitizes
these cells to the effects of tamoxifen.

global O-GlcNAc levels were analysed 48h later by western-blot. (B)
48h after transfection with siRNA, cells were cultured for 24 hours in

after Annexin V-FITC/Propiduim Iodide staining. Statistical analysis was
performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test *, P< 0.05.
Results correspond to the mean+-SEM of 5 independent experiments.
O-GlcNAc-inducing treatments stimulate the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway in MCF-7
cells
The PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway is known as a major anti-apoptotic pathway in MCF-7
cells. To determine whether O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatments may affect this
pathway, we used our previously developed BRET-based assay to monitor
PIP3 production in intact living cells [25]. In this assay, cells are co-transfected with cDNA
coding for the PH domain of Akt fused to Renilla Luciferase and
YFP targeted to the plasma membrane (Figure 4A). Cells were incubated with PUGNAc,
GlcN or both for 6h prior to BRET assay. Whereas treatment with PUGNAc or GlcN
alone had only modest effects on PIP3 production, a significant increase was
observed when both agents were added together (Figure 4B, C). In agreement with this result,
we observed that PUGNAc+GlcN treatment for 6 or 24h resulted in increased Akt
phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4D).

Figure 4
O-GlcNAc-inducing treatments stimulate the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway in

(A) Principle of the BRET assay to measure PIP3 production in
living cells. Activation of PI-3 kinase induces the phosphorylation of
phosphatidyl-inositol 2 phosphate (PIP2) into
phosphatidyl-inositol 3 phosphate (PIP3) and subsequent
recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane through its pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain. To monitor the production of PIP3
induced by receptor activation, cells are co-transfected with cDNAs
coding for the PH domain of Akt fused to luciferase (Luc-Akt-PH) and YFP
fused to a membrane localization sequence. (B) 48 h after transfection,
cells were pre-incubated for 6 h in presence of PUGNAc, GlcN or both.
Cells were incubated for 10 min with coelenterazine, then light
acquisition at 480 nm and 530 nm started. A typical experiment is shown.
(C) PUGNAc and GlcNAc-induced BRET (BRET above basal at the plateau).
Results are the means +- S.E.M. of 4 to 8 independent experiments.
Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Dunnet's
post-test. **, P< 0.01 when compared to untreated control. (D) Effect
of O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatment on Akt phosphorylation. MCF-7
cells were incubated in the absence or presence of PUGNAc+GlcN for 6h or
24 h and lysed. The phosphorylation of Akt was evaluated by western-blot
using anti-phospho-S473-Akt antibody.
Protection of 4-OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death by O-GlcNAc-inducing
treatments is independent of PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway
To determine whether PUGNAc+GlcN protective effects against
4-OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death were mediated by their stimulatory effect on
PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway, we evaluated the effects of these treatments in
presence of LY294002, a PI-3 kinase inhibitor. We observed that LY294002, which
markedly inhibited Akt phosphorylation in these conditions (Figure S2),
did not impair PUGNAc+GlcN rescue from 4-OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death (Figure 5). This result
strongly suggested that the protective effect of O-GlcNAcylation-inducing
treatment is not mediated by the PI-3 kinase pathway.
10.1371/journal.pone.0069150.g005
Figure 5
Protection of MCF-7 cells from 4-OH-tamoxifen-induced cell death is
not abrogated by inhibition of the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway.
MCF-7 cells were cultured in presence of 1% FBS during 24 hours in the
absence or presence PUGNAc (100 mM), Glucosamine (GlcN, 5 mM),
4-OH-tamoxifen (10 mM) and either DMSO (vehicle) or the PI-3 kinase
inhibitor LY294002 (LY) at a concentration of 10 or 20 uM. The growth
of the cell population in each well was evaluated using
Uptiblue-based-assay as the ratio of final fluorescence over the initial
one (broken line) in the same well. Each determination corresponds to
measurements performed in triplicate wells. Results are the mean+-SEM of
3 independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using
ANOVA followed by Dunnet's post-test. *, P< 0.05 when compared to
corresponding untreated control; NS, not significant.
Independence of the PI-3kinase pathway was confirmed by evaluating the effect of
IGF-1. As previously demonstrated [25],
IGF-1 markedly stimulated PIP3 production in these cells (Figure 6A, B). Although IGF-1
had a much higher effect on PIP3 production than PUGNAc+GlcN (Figure 6B), no significant
rescue from 4-OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death was observed (Figure 6C). In contrast, the protective
effect of PUGNAc+GlcN against tamoxifen induced cell death was still observed,
and was similar in absence and presence of IGF1.
10.1371/journal.pone.0069150.g006
Figure 6
IGF-1 treatment does not protect MCF-7 cells from
4OH-tamoxifen-induced cell death.
(A) MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with cDNAs coding for the PH domain
of Akt fused to luciferase (Luc-Akt-PH) and YFP fused to a membrane
localization sequence. 48 h after transfection, cells were pre-incubated
for 6 h in the absence or presence of PUGNAc+GlcN. Cells were incubated
for 10 min with coelenterazine and then stimulated with 100 nM IGF-1.
Light acquisition at 480 nm and 530 nm started immediately after IGF-1
addition. A typical experiment is shown. (B) PUGNAc+GlcNAc and
IGF-1-induced BRET (BRET above basal at the plateau). Results are the
means +- S.E.M. of at least 5 independent experiments. Statistical
analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test. *,
P< 0.05; **, P< 0.01; NS, not significant. (C) MCF-7 cells were
cultured in presence of 1% FBS during 24 h in the absence or presence
PUGNAc (100 uM), Glucosamine (GlcN, 5 mM), 4-OH-tamoxifen (10 uM) and
IGF-1 (100 nM). Cell population growth in each well was evaluated using
an Uptiblue-based-assay as the ratio of final fluorescence over the
initial one (broken line) in the same well. Each determination
corresponds to measurements performed in triplicate wells. Results are
the mean+-SEM of 5 independent experiments. Statistical analysis was
performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-test. *, P< 0.05; **,
P< 0.01; NS, not significant.
Therefore, although these experiments reveal a novel and highly interesting
effect of O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatments on the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway,
protection against 4-OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death by these treatments appears
to be independent of this pathway.
ERa expression is inhibited by increased O-GlcNAcylation in MCF-7
cells
Tamoxifen effects on breast cancer are largely mediated by its antagonistic
action against the estrogen receptor. A number of evidences indicate that the
breast cancer cell sensitivity to tamoxifen depends on the expression level of
the estrogen receptor ERa [33,34]. Low expression level of
ESR1 gene, which codes for ERa, is an important determinant
of tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast tumors [35]. We hypothesised that treatment with
O-GlcNAcylation-inducing agents may reduce 4-OH-Tamoxifen-induced cell death
through inhibition of ERa. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of PUGNAc+GlcN on
the expression of ERa in MCF-7 cells by RT-qPCR and western-blotting. As shown
in Figure 7, 24h treatment
of MCF-7 cells with PUGNAc+GlcN markedly reduced ERa expression at both the mRNA
and protein levels. Time-course experiments (Figure 8) indicated that inhibition of ERa
expression could already be detected at the mRNA level 6h after of treatment
with PUGNAc+GlcN (Figure
8A), and was readily detected at the protein level after 12 h of
treatment (Figure 8B).

experiments. (B) Cells were lysed at the indicated times and the
expression of ERa protein was analysed by western-blot. GAPDH expression
level was used as loading control. The effect of PUGNAc+GlcN treatment
on O-GlcNAcylation of proteins was controlled using anti-O-GlcNAc
antibody. Results are representative of at least 3 independent
experiments.
To determine whether O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatments affect ERa expression
through a transcriptional mechanism, we transfected MCF-7 cells with a reporter
gene constituting of the firefly luciferase coding sequence under the control of
ESR1 promoter. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were
treated with PUGNAc+GlcN for 24h, and then lysed for luciferase activity
measurements. As shown in Figure
9A, PUGNAc+GlcN treatment markedly reduced the expression of
ESR1 promoter reporter gene. To further confirm the role of
protein O-GlcNAcylation in the regulation of ESR1 promoter, a
luciferase reporter gene assay was performed after over-expression of OGT.
Transfection with OGT cDNA increased OGT expression and protein O-GlcNAcylation
in MCF-7 cells (Figure S3). Figure
9B shows that the ESR1-Luc reporter gene expression
was significantly reduced when OGT cDNA was co-transfected with the reporter
gene. This inhibitory effect was accentuated by glucosamine, which provides
UDP-GlcNAc to OGT. We also evaluated the effect of PUGNAc+GlcN on ERa expression
in presence of tamoxifen. The inhibitory effect of PUGNAc+GlcN on
ESR1 promoter activity was still observed when cells were
cultured in presence of tamoxifen (Figure S4A). At the mRNA level, tamoxifen
alone tended to decrease the expression of ERa As a consequence, in presence of
tamoxifen, although PUGNAc+GlcN further decreased ERa mRNA level, the difference
between cells treated or not with PUGNAc+GlcN was not significant. However, it
should be noted that whereas the decrease in mRNA level induced by tamoxifen
alone was not significant when compared to untreated control cells, this effect
became significant in presence of PUGNAc+GlcN, indicating that PUGNAc+GlcN
favours inhibition of ERa mRNA expression, even in presence of tamoxifen (Figure
S4B). At the protein level, tamoxifen increased ERa, in agreement with
previous data showing that tamoxifen increase ERa protein expression through a
post-transcriptional mechanism [36],
presumably by protecting ERa from proteasomal degradation [37,38]. However,
despite tamoxifen-induced increase in ERa protein level, PUGNAc+GlcN treatment
was still capable of significantly decreasing ERa protein expression (Figure S4C and
D). This suggests that in presence of tamoxifen, under PUGNAc+GlcN
conditions, less ERa protein is available to transmit tamoxifen effects compared
to the minus PUGNAc+GlcN condition.

Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Each determination was
performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA
followed by Tukey's post-test **, P< 0.01; ***, P< 0.001. Results
correspond to the mean+-SEM of 4 independent experiments.
To determine whether O-GlcNAc-induced inhibition of ERa expression was associated
with an inhibition of tamoxifen effect on gene expression, we studied the mRNA
expression of genes coding for p21 and Egr1 by RT-qPCR. p21 and Egr1 negatively
regulate cell proliferation and were previously shown to be activated by
tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells [39,40]. We observed PUGNAc+GlcN reduced the
stimulatory effect of tamoxifen on the expression of these genes (Figure 10).

and the level of p21 and Egr1 mRNA was evaluated by RT-qPCR and
normalised using Cyclophilin A expression levels. Results are the mean
+-SEM of 3 independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by
ANOVA followed by Dunnet's post-test. *, P< 0.05; **, P< 0.01 when
compared to untreated control.
Altogether, these data suggest that O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatments inhibited
ERa expression, and this inhibition was associated with a reduction of tamoxifen
effect on key genes involved in regulation of cell proliferation.

Discussion
O-GlcNAcylation has been implicated as an important determinant in cancer cell growth
and migration [16-21]. However, its role in the sensitivity to anti-cancer
therapy was not investigated in these studies. In the present work, we demonstrate
that increasing O-GlcNAcylation results in important protective effects against
tamoxifen-induced cell death in the MCF-7 cell line.
In MCF-7 cells, increased activity of the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway has been previously
shown to participate in resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents, including
tamoxifen [41]. To evaluate the potential
involvement of this pathway in the protective effects of O-GlcNAc-inducing
treatments, we used our previously developed BRET-based assay to assess
PIP3 level in living cells. We observed that PUGNAc+GlcN treatment
significantly increased PIP3 production in MCF-7 cells and was associated
with an increase in Akt phosphorylation. Interestingly, recent work also suggested a
link between PI-3 kinase activity and OGT expression level in cancer cells [42]. The mechanism by which O-GlcNAc increases
PI-3K/Akt pathway activity in MCF-7 cells remains elusive. Whereas O-GlcNAcylation
of the p85 subunit [43] of PI-3K has been
previously described, its consequences on its activity have not been studied.
Moreover, whereas O-GlcNAcylation of Akt has been largely described [5,9,44,45],
this modification is rather associated with a decrease in its phosphorylation.
PIP3 level at the plasma membrane depends on the balance between
PIP2 phosphorylation by PI-3 kinase activity and PIP3
dephosphorylation by the lipid-phosphatase PTEN. Clearly, the effect of O-GlcNAc
treatment on PI-3 kinase and PTEN expression and/or activity in MCF-7 cells deserves
further investigations.
Whatever the mechanism involved in O-GlcNAc-induced increase in PI-3-kinase/Akt
pathway in these cells, it does not appear to play a significant role in the
protective effect of O-GlcNAc against tamoxifen-induced cell death. Indeed,
pharmacological inhibition of the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway using LY294002 did not
impair the protective effects of PUGNAc+GlcN treatments on 4-OH-tamoxifen induced
cell death. Moreover, using IGF1, we demonstrated that activation of PI-3 kinase is
not sufficient to rescue MCF-7 cells from tamoxifen effects, whereas PUGNAc+GlcNAc
treatment was still efficient under these conditions. This prompted us to
investigate whether O-GlcNAcylation, rather than acting through a general
anti-apoptotic signalling pathway, may affect a protein more specifically involved
in tamoxifen action.
Tamoxifen exerts its effects on estrogen-receptor positive cells by binding to ERa.
ERa expression is both necessary and sufficient to predict the responsiveness to
anti-estrogen in a high proportion of breast tumors, and low expression level is
generally associated with a poor prognosis [33-35,46,47].
We observed that O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatment results in inhibition of ERa
expression, suggesting a potential mechanism for decreased tamoxifen effect.
Inhibition of ERa mRNA expression could be detected after only 6 h of treatment, and
luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that PUGNAc+GlcN treatments inhibit the
activity of the ESR1 promoter reporter gene. This suggests that the inhibition of
ERa expression occurred at least in part through a transcriptional repression
mechanism. This inhibition appeared to be independent of the effect of O-GlcNAc on
PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway, because treatment of MCF-7 cells with LY294002 did not
impair inhibition of ERa expression by PUGNAc+GlcN treatment (data not shown).
Positive and negative regulation of gene expression by post-translational
modification of transcription factors has been largely documented [8,48,49]. Interestingly, Sp1, one
the first transcription factors identified to be modified by O-GlcNAcylation [50], is known to bind to and positively
regulate the ESR1 promoter activity [51]. Indeed, Sp1 appears to participate in a transcription
complex (comprised of USF1 and ERa itself) that regulates the expression of
ESR1. O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 has been largely associated with
decreased transcriptional activity on various promoters, generally through
dissociation of its interaction with transcription factors or co-activators [52-58].
Therefore, is would be of interest to determine whether the effect of PUGNAc+GlcN in
MCF-7 cells is associated with dissociation of this complex.
Expression of the ERa, a good prognostic factor in breast cancer, is associated with
higher levels of p21 proteins. Tamoxifen is known to modulate the expression of
genes involved in cell proliferation and cell death. Increased expression of the
cell cycle regulator p21WAF1/CIP1 is believed to play a role in cell
cycle arrest upon treatment with tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs [39,59].
Moreover, down-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 using antisense RNA abrogates
anti-estrogen-mediated cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells [39]. Similarly, Egr1 is deleted in ER-negative human breast
carcinoma, which is suggested to contribute to the poor prognosis of ER-negative
versus ER-positive breast carcinomas [60].
Decreased Egr1 expression in human, mouse and rat mammary cells and tissues
correlated with tumor formation, and tamoxifen treatment was shown to restore its
expression in rat mammary tumors [40].
Moreover, in the ER-positive breast cancer cells MDA-MB-361, tamoxifen-induced
increase in Egr1 expression resulted in activation p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter
and increased transcription of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene,
providing a link between Egr1 transcriptional activity,
p21 expression and tamoxifen-induced cell cycle arrest [61]. Our results indicated that
O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatment reduced the stimulatory effect of tamoxifen on
Egr1 and p21 expression, providing a potential
mechanism for the protective effects of O-GlcNAc on tamoxifen-induced inhibition of
cell growth. However, the effect tamoxifen on Egr1 and
p21 gene expression is only partially inhibited by
O-GlcNAc-inducing treatments. This may in part reflect the fact that
O-GlcNAc-induced inhibition of ERa expression is only partial (Figures 7 and 8), and the remaining receptors could be
responsible for the residual effect of tamoxifen.
In summary, we have observed that increased O-GlcNAcylation in MCF-7 cells have
inhibitory effects on tamoxifen induced cell death. Although O-GlcNAc-inducing
treatments stimulate the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway through an unknown mechanism,
protection from tamoxifen-induced cell death appear to be independent of this
pathway. Moreover, we observed that increased O-GlcNAcylation reduces the expression
of ERa, one of the main determinants of tamoxifen sensitivity. However, several
laboratories have shown that tamoxifen can have ERa-independent anti-proliferative
and pro-apotptotic effects [62-64]. In the present study, it cannot be ruled
out that O-GlcNAcylation may also protect MCF-7 cells from ERa-independent effects
of tamoxifen. Therefore, additional work will be required to determine to what
extent reduction in ERa expression is responsible for reduced tamoxifen effect upon
O-GlcNAcylation-inducing treatment. Overall, although no firm conclusion can be
drawn concerning the mechanism(s) by which O-GlcNcylation protects MCF-7 cells from
tamoxifen effects, our results suggest that targeting the O-GlcNAc pathway might be
an interesting therapeutic approach for sensitisation of anti-estrogen resistant
breast tumors.
