[Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion]

Fuzzy method for pre-diagnosis of breast cancer from the Fine Needle Aspirate
analysis. Background Across the globe, breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women and, currently, Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) with visual interpretation is the easiest and fastest biopsy technique for the diagnosis of this deadly disease. Unfortunately, the ability of this method to diagnose cancer correctly when the disease is present varies greatly, from 65% to 98%. This article introduces a method to assist in the diagnosis and second opinion of breast cancer from the analysis of descriptors extracted from smears of breast mass obtained by FNA, with the use of computational intelligence resources - in this case, fuzzy logic.   Methods For data acquisition of FNA, the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Data (WDBC), from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository, available on the internet through the UCI domain was used. The knowledge acquisition process was carried out by the extraction and analysis of numerical data of the WDBC and by interviews and discussions with medical experts. The PDM-FNA-Fuzzy was developed in four steps: 1) Fuzzification Stage; 2) Rules Base; 3) Inference Stage; and 4) Defuzzification Stage. Performance cross-validation was used in the tests, with three databases with gold pattern clinical cases randomly extracted from the WDBC. The final validation was held by medical specialists in pathology, mastology and general practice, and with gold pattern clinical cases, i.e. with known and clinically confirmed diagnosis.   Results The Fuzzy Method developed provides breast cancer pre-diagnosis with 98.59% sensitivity (correct pre-diagnosis of malignancies); and 85.43% specificity (correct pre-diagnosis of benign cases). Due to the high sensitivity presented, these results are considered satisfactory, both by the opinion of medical specialists in the aforementioned areas and by comparison with other studies involving breast cancer diagnosis using FNA.   Conclusions This paper presents an intelligent method to assist in the diagnosis and second opinion of breast cancer, using a fuzzy method capable of processing and sorting data extracted from smears of breast mass obtained by FNA, with satisfactory levels of sensitivity and specificity. The main contribution of the proposed method is the reduction of the variation hit of malignant cases when compared to visual interpretation currently applied in the diagnosis by FNA. While the MPD-FNA-Fuzzy features stable sensitivity at 98.59%, visual interpretation diagnosis provides a sensitivity variation from 65% to 98% (this track showing sensitivity levels below those considered satisfactory by medical specialists). Note that this method will be used in an Intelligent Virtual Environment to assist the decision-making (IVEMI), which amplifies its contribution.

Background
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide and it is
confirmed that early detection and accurate diagnosis of this disease can ensure
long-term patient survival [1]. According to the World Health Organisation [2], about one third of the costs of cancer treatment can be reduced if cases
are detected and treated early.
On the other hand, aiming to provide greater security, reliability and robustness to
services and procedures, mainly when dealing with human lives, healthcare processes
are increasingly becoming computerized. A growing area of research relates to the
use of techniques from Computational Intelligence (CI) applied to the processing of
information necessary for the medical diagnosis. We can cite as examples, [3-15].
This paper presents a method to assist in breast cancer diagnosis from the analysis
of descriptors extracted from smears of breast mass obtained by FNA (Fine Needle
Aspirate), incorporating features of computational intelligence (in this case, fuzzy
logic) and inserted into a collaborative telediagnosis environment (called IVEMI - [16]).
Diagnosis of breast cancer and FNA
A carcinogen breast tumor is a breast mass that is growing abnormally and
uncontrolled. There are three popular methods for breast cancer diagnosis:
mammography; FNA with visual interpretation; and surgical biopsy [17]. The ability of these methods to diagnose cancer correctly when the
disease is present is: mammogram - from 68% to 79%; FNA with
visual-interpretation - from 65% to 98%; and surgical biopsy - 100%. [18]. It is noted that: mammography lacks sensitivity; the sensitivity of
FNA with visual interpretation varies greatly (as a result of the visual
interpretation); and although surgical biopsy is accurate it is also a very
intrusive, time-consuming and expensive method [19].
FNA, which has been widely accepted in the approach to investigating mammary
lesions, is the easiest and fastest biopsy technique to be performed, being a
percutaneous procedure (through the skin) in which the specialist physician uses
a thin needle (which varies from 0.6 to 0.8 mm) and a syringe to take samples of
fluid from a breast cyst or remove clusters of cells in a solid mass. The needle
is inserted into the skin toward the lesion, with the objective of collecting
cells for further evaluation of their morphology, quantity and distribution
through cytological examination.
The genetic material extracted from the breast by FNA is usually sent to a
Pathology laboratory for examination by pathologists (doctors specialized in
disease diagnosis through lab testing), who perform the analysis identifying the
cells' characteristics from observing, under a microscope, smears made
with this material on sheets of glass and stained using special techniques.
Computational intelligence and fuzzy logic
Computational Intelligence (CI) enables, through intelligent techniques some of
them inspired by nature, the development of intelligent systems that imitate
aspects of human behaviour, such as: learning, perception, reasoning, evolution
and adaptation [20]. Some examples of Computational Intelligence techniques are:
Artificial Neural Networks, biological neuron-inspired technique [14,15]; Evolutionary Computation, inspired by biological evolution [12]; Expert Systems, inspired by inference process [11]; and Fuzzy Logic, inspired by language processing.
The fuzzy systems theory is a formal approach that aims to address the modelling,
representation, reasoning and the inaccurate information procedure as a
troubleshooting strategy [21].
Introduced in 1965 [22], the fuzzy set theory is a tool to model the imprecision and
ambiguity that arises in complex systems [22,23], and it was created from the combination of the concepts of classical
logic and groupings of Lukasiewicz [24] defining degrees of relevance.
A fuzzy set differs from a classic set to assign to each element a value in the
unit interval [0, 1]. Specifically, a fuzzy set is defined as a function A of a
set x, called universe of discourse, to [0, 1]. The function A is referred to as
a membership function, and the value A(x) represents the degree of relevance
- or compatibility - of the element x with the concept represented
by all the fuzzy set. Thus, the fuzzy logic proposed by Zadeh [22,23] provides a mathematical model for the processing of inaccurate or
vague information and concepts, intending to make computers carry out inferences
as people.
The fuzzy processing is generally composed of: Rules Base (provided by
specialists or extracted from numerical data); Fuzzification Stage (it activates
the rules from a set of precise entries); Inference Stage (determines how rules
are enabled); Defuzzification Stage (it provides precise output, generating a
fuzzy set of output), as illustrated in Figure 1.

Methods
This fuzzy method that assists in the diagnosis and second opinion of breast cancer,
called Pre-Diagnosis Module FNA-Fuzzy (PDM-FNA-Fuzzy), was developed through the
analysis of extracted smears from breast mass obtained by FNA. The PDM-FNA-Fuzzy is
inserted into the Intelligent Virtual Environment of Medical Interaction (IVEMI),
which is a virtual environment (architecture shown in Figure 2) from which the doctor responsible can trigger, requesting
pre-diagnosis or second opinion on clinical cases with suspected breast cancer and
whose patient has undergone the examination of FNA.
Figure 2
Architecture of IVEMI.
Data acquisition
For FNA data acquisition, the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Data (WDBC), of
UCI Machine Learning Repository, available on the internet by the domain of
University of California Irvine [25] was used. The WDBC is a public database, consisting of a gold pattern
data set1, i.e. with confirmation of malignant and benign
diagnosis.
The selected database, WDBC, was created in 1993, and presents 569 records of
patients with known diagnosis (357 cases being benign and 212 cases malignant)
and uses material (smears) collected by FNA, transformed into a digital image
from which the main parameters (descriptors) were extracted.
For viewing and manipulating data from WDBC we used MATLAB (MathWorks -
student version).
Pre-processing of data
Samples (small droplets of viscous liquid) were collected from aspiration of
breast mass with thin needle, spread on glass blades slides, stained (aiming to
highlight the cell nuclei) and digitized [26]. Examples of captured images are presented in Figure 3. Then, in the process of digital evaluation performed by
Street et al. [26], the exact location of each cell nucleus was specified, and the
morphometric analysis of the cell nuclei, extracting characteristics such as
size, shape and texture was complete.
Figure 3
Captured images of layers of glass with smears of breast mass
obtained by FNA (the parts stained correspond to cell nuclei).
In addition to the code for the identification and diagnosis (gold
pattern)1, each record of WDBC presents 10 descriptors (related
to the cell nucleus and modelled such that the highest values are associated
with malignancy): radius; texture; perimeter; area; smoothness; compactness;
concavity; concave points; symmetry; and fractal dimension. We must point out
that the mean value, the extreme value and the standard error of each descriptor
were calculated for each image, resulting in a total of 30 (thirty) resources
for each case in the study.
The knowledge acquisition process was accomplished in two ways: (i) extraction
and analysis of numerical data of WDBC, considering the same as gold pattern
(i.e. with diagnosis confirmed)1, and (ii) interviews and discussions
with medical experts2 (of pathology, general practitioner and
mastology areas) who provided technical support and followed the development of
this Pre-Diagnosis Intelligent Method.
To reduce the dimensionality of the problem and optimize the processing tests,
the PCA3 technique in WDBC was applied (average values), once having
verified that the descriptors with higher energy rates are, in decreasing order:
area, perimeter, texture, and radius. The experiment was repeated for the
extreme values, obtaining the same result, and the analyses carried out were
confirmed with medical specialists (of pathology, general practitioner and
mastology areas).
Aimed at the collation and visualization of high-dimensional data, after
normalization of descriptors, the SOM4 algorithm was applied with:
linear initialization; hexagonal topology; gaussian neighborhood function;
neighborhood radius equal to 1; in a 10-dimensional space of characteristics
(descriptors); and with variations in the size of the grid and the amount of
iterations of the algorithm batch type. The results of the application of SOM
were viewed using the Unified distance Matrix (U-Matrix) [27], a technique that presents weight-distance relationships between
neighboring neurons of output space (distance between the units of the grid),
showing a separation between the groups (classes of patterns). In the U-Matrix,
relations between the neighboring neurons are seen on the surface U (x, y) as
"valleys" and "mountains". Valleys - the topographic relief - correspond to the
regions of neurons that are similar, while mountains, i.e. relatively high
values in the U-matrix, reflect the dissimilarity between neighboring neurons
and may be associated with borders of groups of neurons [28]. The topological order property of the SOM, as shown in the right
side scale in Figure 4, in the U-Matrix is as folows:
a dark blue color represents that the distance between the nodes (units) is
small ("valleys") and thus classes of patterns exist; the light blue, green and
yellow indicate an average distance between the nodes (beginning of the
"mountains"); the orange and red represent that there is a great
distance between the nodes ("mountains"), i.e. they are gaps that serve to
separate the classes. The application of the SOM for visualization of
high-dimensional data (Figure 4) showed that it is
not possible to obtain distinct groups (classes of patterns), indicating the
existence of nebulous data groupings in the WDBC, which justifies the use of
Fuzzy logic in the method developed.
Figure 4
SOM applied to visualization pattern matches to high-dimensional data
of WDBC.
Parallel to the application of PCA and SOM and, mainly, through preliminary
analysis of the WDBC descriptors and related images performed along with medical
specialists (in pathology, general practice and mastology), were: a) the
extracted (selected) descriptors that was more relevant to the diagnosis of
breast cancer from the analysis of cell nuclei of smears obtained by FNA, the
most relevant being, the "area", the "perimeter" and the "texture"; b) the
discarded descriptors, "fractal dimension", "compactness" and "concavity",
because they are not actually used in medical practice for pathological
analysis; and c) newly generated descriptors, in order to translate the method
evaluations normally carried out by pathologists and that were not directly
presented in WDBC.
Among the newly generated descriptors, those that presented a significant
influence on the results "improvement" were the descriptors:
"uniformity", difference between the radius extreme value and the
radius mean value, representing whether the cellular nuclei have similar or
highly variable sizes; and "homogeneity", difference between the
extreme value of symmetry and the mean value of symmetry, representing whether
the cellular nuclei have similar or highly variable symmetries.
Complementing the analysis of the numerical data, the minimum and maximum
parameters for each diagnosis known (benign and malignant) of each descriptor
used in the development of PDM-FNA-Fuzzy (as shown in Table 1) were detected, excluding the descriptors discarded by medical
specialists. Results showed the existence of fuzzy intervals for all descriptors
(benign GPD values are within the range of the malignant GPD and vice versa),
not being linearly possible to diagnose breast mass as benign or malignant.
Processing and classification of data - Fuzzy Method
Before the proposed problem involving various fuzzy situations and considering
the literature studied, it was found that the strategy of applying fuzzy logic
could bring greater benefits (like expert knowledge acquisition, rules base
generation, process automation and pre diagnosis greater precision) and
satisfactory results, in addition to dealing with modelling, representation, the
reasoning and the inaccurate information procedure as a troubleshooting
strategy.
Thus, the implementation of the intervention and control actions in the
intelligent method developed, uses fuzzy logic since it enables to capture the
experts' knowledge, as well as the appropriate treatment to fuzzy
situations inherent in the problem classifying smears from breast mass obtained
by FNA.
The algorithm developed to assist the creation of fuzzy system applied to the
medical field is presented below.

Finalize
This way, the definition of Fuzzy Method to assist in the diagnosis of breast
cancer and its stages (Fuzzification Stage, Rules Base, Inference Stage and
Defuzzification Stage) are listed below and instantiated through the system
implemented.
PDM-FNA-Fuzzy Definition
Pre-Diagnosis Module FNA-Fuzzy performs the analysis of extracted descriptors of
smears from breast mass obtained by FNA, considering the parameters that
indicate malignant and benign diagnosis and the fuzzy rules base defined,
responsible for inferences in the set of entries, generating pre-diagnosis,
malignant or benign, to assist the diagnosis of breast cancer made by the
doctor.
Experiments were carried out with all possible combinations of descriptors listed
in Table 1, i.e. in addition to fuzzy methods for
each descriptor, models have been developed for all groups of two, three, four,
and so on up to the limit of nine descriptors, taking into account that the
descriptors correspond to the input variables of fuzzy method. Within the set
AREA, PERIMETER, UNIFORMITY and HOMOGENEITY produced the best results, the
PDM-FNA-Fuzzy in question uses these four descriptors, with fuzzy method as
described below.
Fuzzification Stage
At this stage the input variables have been defined, identifying to which fuzzy
sets they belong, assigning the respective degree to each relevance. The fuzzy
sets, represented by the membership functions, were adjusted by heuristics, on
the universe of discourse in order to improve the results achieved. Thus, before
the creation of the fuzzy system, it was necessary to define the membership
functions (fuzzy sets) used both at the fuzzification and defuzzification
stages. The entries of PDM-FNA-Fuzzy in question are the descriptors AREA,
PERIMETER, UNIFORMITY and HOMOGENENEITY that have been defined through the
membership functions described below:
a. Area membership function (AREA): considering a domain of
[185 - 4255], this membership function is composed of "Smaller AREA" and
"Larger AREA", in linguistic terms SMAREA and LAAREA,
respectively, representing the tracks, according to the fuzzy set below and
illustrated in Figure 5.

c. Uniformity membership function (UNIF): considering a domain
of [0 - 12], this membership function is composed of "More UNIF" and "Less
UNIF", linguistically represented as MOUNIF and LEUNIF,
respectively, representing the tracks, according to the fuzzy set below and
illustrated in Figure 7. It is important to note
that, for this descriptor, more UNIF is associated with lower values (i.e.
smaller values in this descriptor indicate there is more uniformity among the
cellular nuclei and indicate a benign diagnosis) and less UNIF is associated to
larger values (i.e. the larger values in this descriptor indicate there is less
uniformity and indicate malignant diagnosis).

of [0.01 - 0.45], this membership function is composed of "More HOM" and
"Less HOM", in linguistic terms MOHOM and LEHOM,
respectively, representing the tracks, according to the fuzzy set below and
illustrated in Figure 8. It is important to note
that, for this descriptor, more HOM is associated with lower values (i.e.
smaller values in this descriptor indicate there is more homogeneity among the
cellular nuclei and indicate a benign diagnosis) and less HOM is linked to
larger values (i.e. larger values in this descriptor indicate there is less
homogeneity and indicate a diagnosis of malignancy).

The membership functions were built using the direct method, having been
confirmed by the medical experts (in pathology, mastology and general practice)
the parameters extracted from WDBC, covering all data of the membership
functions (values that represent each function and the degree of relevance,
within the function, of each one of them) in order to set them explicitly. There
are several membership functions that can be used at this fuzzification stage.
All functions available in Matlab were applied (trials and tests) on the fuzzy
system concerned, noting that the trapezoidal function was the one that
presented the best results in PDM-FNA-Fuzzy, by best representing the functions
according to the context.
Rules Base - Fuzzy Rules definition
The rules base was assembled with the following structure: IF
<premises>THEN <conclusion>. For the definition of rules of
PDM-FNA-Fuzzy to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer in question, it is
possible to standardize the following structure:

Consequently, 16 (sixteen) rules were defined for PDM-FNA-Fuzzy object of this
study, using 4 (four) descriptors and with 3 (three) possibilities of
pre-diagnosis <results>. To exemplify, below some of the rules:
# Rule 1: If smaller AREA and smaller PERI and
more UNIF (descriptor with lower value) and more HOM
(descriptor with smaller value) then benign diagnosis.
if

and
PERI

and

then

# Rule13: If larger AREA and larger PERI and

(descriptor with smaller value) then diagnosis undefined.
if
AREA
|
and
PERI
|
and
UNIF
|
and
HOM

then

# Rule 16: If larger AREA and larger PERI and

less HOM (descriptor with larger value) then malignant
diagnosis.
if
AREA

and
PERI

and

and

then
M
We must point out that the rules defined (16 rules) cover all possible
combinations of inputs and outputs of the proposed issue and that the
consistency of the rules was examined in order to avoid contradictions. The
rules base, presented in the Table 2, was developed
from the analysis of numerical data and multiple meetings, discussions and
interviews with medical experts from the fields of pathology, mastology, and
general practitioners.
It should be noted that, following the medical practice, the procedure taken for
undefined (Undef) pre-diagnosis (results) are referred to as the situation of
suspected malignant tumour, which indicates a biopsy procedure(similar to the
malignant pre-diagnosis), i.e., if in doubt the patient is referred for a
biopsy. Thus, from the classification point of view for having a biopsy or not,
the PDM-FNA-Fuzzy can be seen as a binary classifier with the record of 2.1%
of cases classified as undefined and thus regarded as malignant.
Inference stage
In this stage, the entries were analysed to generate the fuzzy output set with
its respective compatibility degree. The PDM-FNA-Fuzzy developed used the fuzzy
model proposed by Mamdani [29], in which the activation function of each rule is enabled and the
system of inference determines the degree of compatibility of the rules premise
contained in the rules base. After this, it determines which rules are enabled
and applies them to the output membership function, remaining just linking all
output nebulous sets activated (and their respective degrees of compatibility)
into a single Output Set (OS). This OS represents all results (diagnosis) that
are acceptable for the input set, each with its compatibility level. Each case
was also assessed, at this stage, for all fuzzy rules and the combination of
information was carried out from the rules already defined in the Rules
Base.
Defuzzification stage
This stage was used to generate a single numeric value, from all possible values
contained in the fuzzy set obtained in the inference stage, to generate the
diagnosis. As a diagnosis resulting from the relations and variability of the
descriptors AREA, PERIMETER, UNIFORMITY and HOMOGENEITY, the function centroid
(which presented the best results) and the domain [0 - 1] was adopted for
defuzzification.
The Pre-Diagnosis (PD) membership function, Defuzzification, is composed of
"Benign", "Undefined" and "Malignant", represented linguistically as
BPD, UndefPD and MPD, respectively,
representing the tracks [<= 0.5; 0.5 - 0.6; and >= 0.6], as
output set below and illustrated in Figure 9.

Post-processing
In post-processing, the result, in the form of malignant or benign pre-diagnosis,
is stored on the server and made available on the screen by means of IVEMI (on
the desktop discussion of clinical case), both for the doctor who requested the
pre-diagnosis or second opinion, as to the other users with access permission to
the respective clinical case.
Validation
Testing of the PDM-FNA-Fuzzy, the object of this study, was carried out using the
MATLAB R2010a (student version), due to the tools available in this application
to the development of models and the rapid visualization of the results obtained
in the fuzzy system.
The PDM-FNA-Fuzzy developed to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer performs
the interaction between the descriptors AREA, PERIMETER, UNIFORMITY and
HOMOGENEITY (extracted from smears obtained by FNA), operated by inference rules
of the system expert in fuzzy logic, triggering classification and assistance in
medical diagnosis actions.
All the tests were initially carried out using the WDBC, even the identification
of the main characteristics of the fuzzy system, such as:
the identification of the set of descriptors that provide the best
results, called "best input set" (BIS);
identification of the best set of rules (BSR); and
the definition of what membership functions, which parameters and what
defuzzification functions are most suitable for use with the BIS and the
BSR.
The membership functions and their respective fuzzy final sets of each descriptor
used, AREA, PERIMETER, UNIFORMITY and HOMOGENEITY, are presented, respectively,
in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8.
The validation of the rules base was held in conjunction with medical
professionals (in pathology, general practice and mastology), considering the
fuzzy set indicators of both malignant and benign diagnosis. As a consequent
action of the descriptors' relations and variability the domain [0
-1], representing the tracks [< 0.5; 0.5 - 0.6; > 0.6], was
adopted to defuzzification, which is represented in linguistic terms as
"Benign", "Undefined" and "Malignant",
respectively, as presented in Figure 9.
After this phase, cross-validation was used for testing, in order to fine-tune
the parameters of the membership functions of PDM-FNA-Fuzzy. Therefore, three
databases were generated, each of them with 150 (one hundred and fifty) gold
pattern clinical cases randomly extracted from WDBC.
The validation of PDM-FNA-Fuzzy was performed using a database with 100 (one
hundred) gold pattern clinical cases (i.e. diagnosis known and confirmed),
randomly extracted from WDBC.
We must point out that the validations of both the knowledge gained and the
results achieved were performed during the development of PDM-FNA-Fuzzy and
also, in the final instance, by medical specialists in the areas of pathology,
mastology and general practice.

f) defuzzification: Centroid function;
g) output variable: 1 (result = pre-diagnosis).
The best result achieved is shown in the Diagnostic Test Assessment Matrix presented
in Table 3, as well as in the Matrix of Confusion
presented in Table 4.
It is noted in the diagnostic test assessment matrix (Table 3), that the PDM-FNA-Fuzzy developed presents: 98.59% sensitivity,
which is the ability of a diagnostic test to identify the real positive in
individuals truly ill, meaning a satisfactory percentage of hits in the
pre-diagnosis of malignancies; and 85.43% specificity, which is the ability of a
diagnostic test to identify the real negative in individuals truly healthy,
corresponding to the correct pre-diagnosis of benign cases.
We must point out that, in the laboratory examination (biopsy) of smears obtained by
FNA for identification of breast cancer, it is more important to get good results in
sensitivity than in specificity ([30-32]). Subsequently, among the tests performed during the development of
PDM-FNA-Fuzzy to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer, there were several with
satisfactory results as well, but they were not selected as the best solution,
having been discarded, as, for example, the test sets A, B and C, presented
below.
The tests of set A were conducted from the best input set, with changes in nebulous
sets (parameters) of the membership functions. In Table 5, the results of sensitivity and specificity of the same are presented.
Notably test A.1 presents 99.06% sensitivity, however the medical experts found
the specificity of 64.15% unsatisfactory. The tests A.8 and A.10 presented the
same sensitivity of PDM-FNA-Fuzzy developed (98.59%), but lower specificity
(84.31% and 84.87%, respectively). The other tests presented sensitivity
less than 98.59% and thus were discarded.
The tests of set B were conducted from the best input set, with changes in the types
of membership function of the input set and, consequently, in their nebulous set
(parameters). In Table 6, the results of sensitivity and
specificity of the same are presented. Notably the tests B.1 and B.4 showed the same
sensitivity that the PDM-FNA-Fuzzy developed (98.59%), but lower specificity
(84.47% and 82.91%, respectively). The other tests showed sensitivity less
than 98.59%, having been discarded.
The C set were performed from the best input set, with changes only in the
defuzzification function. Presented in Table 7, are the
results of sensitivity and specificity of the same. It is worthy to note that all of
the tests presented the same sensitivity that the PDM-FNA-Fuzzy developed
(98.59%), but lower specificity.
Thus, the results achieved by the PDM-FNA-Fuzzy, the object of this study, were
considered satisfactory by medical specialists (in pathology, general practice and
mastology), mainly for their high sensitivity (malignant cases hit) presented, as
can be seen in Table 3.
The sensitivity of 98.59% presented by MPD-FNA-Fuzzy is at the same level of
prominence of other works using the same dataset with other techniques such as, for
example, [11] and [14], using Probabilistic Neural Network-PNN with 31-568-2 topology. Although
other works, for example, [11], [12][14], [15], are more accurate than MPD-FNA-Fuzzy, they use ten descriptors, while
the MPD-FNA-Fuzzy uses only four descriptors, two of which are extracted indirectly
from WDBC, which simplifies the model and streamlines processing.

Conclusions
This work presented an intelligent method to assist the diagnosis and second opinion
of breast cancer, using a fuzzy method capable of processing and sorting data
(descriptors) extracted from smears of breast mass obtained by FNA.
Processing, testing and validation using fuzzy method were carried out by medical
specialists using the gold pattern database, i.e. with real data and real and
verified diagnosis.
The main contributions of this paper are:
* specification and implementation of fuzzy method
(MPD-FNA-Fuzzy) that meets the requirements to assist breast cancer diagnosis,
carried out using the analysis of real data and contact with experts;
* reduction of malignant cases variation hit when compared to
visual interpretation currently applied in the diagnosis by FNA. While the
MPD-FNA-Fuzzy features stable sensitivity in 98.59%, visual interpretation
diagnosis provides a sensitivity variation from 65% to 98%, this track
showing sensitivity levels below those considered satisfactory by medical
specialists;
* the use of intelligent systems techniques, more
specifically, fuzzy logic, to assist the diagnosis and second opinion of breast
cancer from smears of FNA;
* development of a Pre-Diagnosis Method that can be embedded
into a virtual environment of medical interaction;
* detection of the main descriptors of WDBC to assist the
diagnosis of breast cancer;
* creation, from the WDBC, of new important descriptors to
assist the breast cancer diagnosis: UNIFORMITY and HOMOGENEITY;
* definition of algorithm for fuzzy system development applied
to the medical field.
