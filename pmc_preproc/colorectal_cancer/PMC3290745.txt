Chitinase 3-like 1 promotes macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer. Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), one of mammalian members of the chitinase family, is expressed in several types of human cancer, and elevated serum level of CHI3L1 is suggested to be a biomarker of poor prognosis in advanced cancer patients. However, the overall biological function of CHI3L1 in human cancers still remains unknown. Studies were performed to characterize the role of CHI3L1 in cancer pathophysiology utilizing human colorectal cancer samples and human cell lines. Plasma protein and tissue mRNA expression levels of CHI3L1 in colorectal cancer were strongly upregulated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CHI3L1 was expressed in cancer cells and CHI3L1 expression had a significant association with the number of infiltrated macrophages and microvessel density. By utilizing trans-well migration and tube formation assays, overexpression of CHI3L1 in SW480 cells (human colon cancer cells) enhanced the migration of THP-1 cells (human macrophage cells) and HUVECs (human endothelial cells), and the tube formation of HUVECs. The knockdown of CHI3L1 by RNA interference or the neutralization of CHI3L1 by anti-CHI3L1 antibody displayed strong suppression of CHI3L1-induced migration and tube formation. Cell proliferation assay showed that CHI3L1 overexpression significantly enhanced the proliferation of SW480 cells. ELISA analysis showed that CHI3L1 increased the secretion of inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and MCP-1, from SW480 cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Both neutralization of IL-8 or MCP-1 and inhibition or knockdown of MAPK in SW480 cells significantly inhibited CHI3L1-induced migration and tube formation. In a xenograft mouse model, overexpression of CHI3L1 in HCT116 cells (human colon cancer cells) enhanced the tumor growth as well as macrophage infiltration and microvessel density. In conclusion, CHI3L1 expressed in colon cancer cells promotes cancer cell proliferation, macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis. Thus, the inhibition of CHI3L1 activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for human colorectal cancer.

Introduction
Tumors consist of both cancer cells and stromal cells that are recruited to or activated in the local microenvironment. Recent studies indicated that tumor growth and dissemination are the result of dynamic interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment (Mantovani et al., 2008). Macrophages are one of the major populations of infiltrating cells in cancer stroma, and recent reports showed that recruited macrophages within cancers lack the ability to present antigen and contribute to cancer progression by the release of growth and angiogenic factors (Mantovani et al., 2002; Pollard, 2004). Tumor angiogenesis is also an essential part of cancer development and involves a multistep process of endothelial cell migration and tube formation (Hanahan and Folkman, 1996). Angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration often share common pathways, and these two biological processes are closely coupled with cancer progression (Ono, 2008).
Chitinases are enzymes that degrade chitin and belong to the family 18 of glycosyl hydrolases (Henrissat and Davies, 1997). Because chitin composes the cell wall of fungi and exoskeletal elements of crustaceans and insects, chitinases are found in organisms that need to protect themselves from fugal infection or to reshape their own chitin (Herrera-Estrella and Chet, 1999). Although chitinases had been considered to be lacking in mammalian bodies due to the absence of chitin, recent studies identified chitinases and chitinase-like proteins in mammals (Rejman and Hurley, 1998; Hakala et al., 1993; Shackelton et al., 1995). Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), also known as human cartilage-glycoprotein 39 (HC-gp39) or YKL-40, is a member of the mammalian chitinase family, but lacks enzymatic activity (Henrissat and Bairoch, 1993). Although CHI3L1 is not synthesized under physiological conditions, the expression of CHI3L1 is observed in patients with several types of cancers and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and bronchial asthma (Johansen, 2006; Mizoguchi, 2006; Chupp et al., 2007: Eurich et al., 2009). We recently reported that CHI3L1 is highly induced in colonic epithelial cells under inflammatory conditions and enhances pathogenic bacterial adhesion and invasion on/into colonic epithelial cells (Mizoguchi, 2006; Kawada et al., 2007; Kawada et al., 2008). It has been shown that CHI3L1 stimulates proliferation of connective tissue cells, including fibroblasts, chondrocytes and synovial cells and modulates expression levels of chemokines and metalloproteases in inflammatory fibroblasts, and also enhances chemotaxis of endothelial cells (Recklies et al., 2002; Ling and Recklies, 2004, Malinda et al., 1999). These data suggest that CHI3L1 may have an important role on stromal cells not only in inflammatory conditions but also in cancer development.
In this study, we focused on analyzing the biological role of CHI3L1 in the tumor microenvironment. For this purpose, we investigated whether CHI3L1 expressed in cancer cells promotes chemotaxis of macrophage and angiogenesis for the progression of colorectal cancer by utilizing human colorectal cancer samples as well as human cell lines.

Results
Expression of CHI3L1 in colorectal cancer
We initially examined the plasma levels of CHI3L1 by ELISA. The plasma CHI3L1 concentration of colorectal cancer patients was significantly higher than that of controls, and the increase was positively associated with TNM stages (Figure 1A). To test whether the increased expression of CHI3L1 can be detected in the colonic tissue of human colorectal cancer, surgically resected samples were subjected to quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical analysis. As shown in Figure 1B, the mRNA levels of CHI3L1/GAPDH in cancer tissues were significantly higher than the adjacent normal tissues of the same patients. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CHI3L1 was mainly expressed in colorectal cancer cells rather than stromal cells (Figure 1C). Based on the expression levels of CHI3L1, we divided the 61 cases of colorectal cancer into two groups (Figure 1C). Out of 61 cases, 60.7% showed strong expression of CHI3L1 and 39.3% displayed weak expression. Interestingly, strong CHI3L1 expression was significantly correlated with T stage, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis (Supplementary Table 1). To further explore a possible role of CHI3L1 in tumor microenvironment, we stained the serial sections with anti-CD68 and -vWF antibodies. Quantitative analysis indicated that the number of infiltrating CD68+ macrophages was significantly higher in cancers than in normal samples. Moreover, the number of infiltrating CD68+ macrophages was significantly higher in cancers with strong CHI3L1 expression than those with weak expression, the mean number of infiltrating macrophages being 121.1 and 95.7, respectively (Figure 1D). Staining of vWF showed a markedly higher microvessel density (MVD) in cancers than in normal samples. Moreover, MVD was higher in cancers with strong CHI3L1 expression than those with weak CHI3L1 expression, the mean number of MVD being 60.0 and 46.7, respectively (Figure 1E). Also, strong expression of CHI3L1 was associated with the concomitant increase of the number of infiltrating macrophages and the MVD (Supplementary Table 2). CHI3L1 expression was thus closely associated with the number of infiltrating macrophages and also with the degree of MVD in human colorectal cancer.
Effect of CHI3L1 on proliferation of colon cancer cells and on migration of macrophages
We next explored whether CHI3L1 expressed in cancer cells influences the cancer progression in vitro. We generated a CHI3L1 expression vector and two different kinds of CHI3L1 specific miRNAs as described in Materials and Methods. Western blotting confirmed that the protein level of CHI3L1 was up-regulated by CHI3L1 overexpression in SW480 cells, whereas CHI3L1 specific miRNAs suppressed the protein expression of endogenous CHI3L1 in SW480 cells compared with scrambled negative control miRNA (Figure 2A). Cell proliferation assay showed that CHI3L1 overexpression significantly enhanced the proliferation of SW480 cells as compared with empty vector. CHI3L1 miRNAs significantly suppressed the proliferation of SW480 cells (Figure 2B).
Macrophages are a major component of infiltrating cells in cancer stroma and have served as a promoter for cancer progression (Mantovani et al., 2008). To investigate the effect of CHI3L1 on macrophage infiltration into cancer stroma, THP-1 cells (human macrophage cells) and SW480 cells (human colon cancer cells) were co-cultured using the double-chamber. We observed increased migration of THP-1 cells when co-cultured with SW480 cells that endogenously expressed CHI3L1 as compared with no cells in the lower chamber (Figure 2C). Moreover, stimulation of SW480 cells with purified CHI3L1 protein further enhanced the migration of THP-1 cells. CHI3L1 overexpression in SW480 cells also increased the migration of THP-1 cells by 2.2 fold as compared with mock transfection. To confirm that the enhanced migration of THP-1 cells is mediated by CHI3L1, studies to inhibit CHI3L1 activity were performed. Anti-CHI3L1 neutralizing Ab treatment significantly inhibited the CHI3L1-enhanced migration of THP-1 cells, although control IgG did not have any inhibitory action. CHI3L1 miRNAs transfection in SW480 cells also significantly inhibited the migration of THP-1 cells (Figure 2D). These results suggest that CHI3L1 expression in colon cancer cells promotes the proliferation of cancer cells and the chemotaxis of macrophages.
Effect of CHI3L1 on migration and tube formation of endothelial cells
Angiogenesis is a key mechanism that supports cancer development by providing nutrients and oxygen (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). To examine the influence of CHI3L1 on angiogenesis, SW480 cells and HUVECs (human endothelial cells) were co-cultured using the double-chamber. Under the co-culture with SW480 cells, HUVECs significantly enhanced their migration as compared with no cells in the lower chamber (Figure 3A). Moreover, stimulation of SW480 cells with purified CHI3L1 protein further enhanced the migration of HUVECs. CHI3L1 overexpression in SW480 cells also increased the migration of HUVECs by 1.8 fold as compared with mock transfection. The CHI3L1-mediated HUVECs migration was significantly inhibited by anti-CHI3L1 neutralizing Ab, although control IgG did not have any inhibitory effects. Furthermore, CHI3L1 miRNAs transfection in SW480 cells significantly suppressed the migration of HUVECs (Figure 3B).
Since CHI3L1 stimulated the migration of endothelial cells, we next examined the effect of CHI3L1 on the tube formation of HUVECs. As expected, HUVECs tube formation was significantly enhanced by conditioned medium harvested from SW480 cells (Figure 3C) as compared with basal medium. Moreover, stimulation with purified CHI3L1 protein enhanced the tube formation. We found that the conditioned medium harvested from the CHI3L1-overexpressed SW480 cells further enhanced the tube formation, compared with the conditioned medium harvested from the control vector-transfected SW480 cells. The enhancement of HUVEC tube formation by the conditioned medium derived from the CHI3L1-overexpressed SW480 cells was inhibited efficiently by anti-CHI3L1 neutralizing Ab, although control IgG did not show the inhibitory effect. The transfection of CHI3L1 miRNAs in SW480 cells also significantly suppressed the HUVEC tube formation (Figure 3D). Taken together, these findings suggest that CHI3L1 expressed in colon cancer cells plays a pivotal role in promoting the angiogenesis.
Enhanced chemotaxis of macrophages and angiogenesis by CHI3L1-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 protein secretions
Next, we further explored the ability of CHI3L1 to promote the release of inflammatory chemokines for migration and tube formation. IL-8 (CXCL8) is one of the extensively studied chemokines as a mitogenic and angiogenic factor for cancer progression. In addition, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) is also known to be important in tumorigenesis as a macrophage chemoattractant and angiogenic modulator (Singh et al., 2007; Lazennec and Richmond, 2010). ELISA showed that CHI3L1 overexpression in SW480 cells significantly and dose-dependently increased the protein secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1 as compared with the control vector-transfected SW480 cells (Figure 4A). Quantitative RT-PCR also showed that CHI3L1 overexpression in SW480 cells significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 (Figure 4B). We further found that the CHI3L1 miRNAs transfection significantly decreased the release of IL-8 and MCP-1 from SW480 cells (Figure 4C). These results indicate that CHI3L1 enhances the secretion of inflammatory chemokines including IL-8 and MCP-1 from human colon cancer cells.
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, we observed increased migration of THP-1 cells and HUVECs when incubated with CHI3L1-overexpressed SW480 cells in trans-well migration assay. We found that incubation with IL-8 neutralizing Ab significantly diminished the enhanced migration of THP-1 cells and HUVECs induced by CHI3L1 in SW480 cells. Incubation with MCP-1 neutralizing Ab also significantly inhibited the enhanced migration of THP-1 cells and HUVECs by CHI3L1. In contrast, incubation with control goat IgG did not affect the enhanced capability of CHI3L1 (Figure 4D, E). Neutralization with anti-IL-8 or -MCP-1 antibody significantly inhibited the tube formation induced by empty vector-transfected or CHI3L1-treated conditioned medium as compared with control goat IgG (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results suggest that CHI3L1-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 protein secretions from colon cancer cells enhance chemotaxis of macrophages and angiogenesis.
Enhanced chemotaxis of macrophages and angiogenesis through ERK1/2 and JNK signaling in colon cancer cells
The MAPK cascade is an evolutionarily conserved pathway playing an important role in cancer development (Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004). We, therefore, examined the role of MAPK in CHI3L1-mediated macrophage chemotaxis and angiogenesis. SW480 cells were transfected with CHI3L1 expression- or miRNA- vector, and MAPK phosphorylation was determined using phospho-specific antibodies. CHI3L1 overexpression up-regulated ERK and JNK phosphorylation in SW480 cells (Figure 5A). On the other hand, CHI3L1 knockdown by CHI3L1 miRNAs abolished ERK and JNK phosphorylation induced by CHI3L1 expression in SW480 cells. In contrast, phosphorylation of p38 was unaffected by CHI3L1 overexpression or knockdown.
We explored involvement of MAPK cascade in CHI3L1-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion from colon cancer cells. ELISA showed that ERK inhibitor (PD98059) and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) significantly diminished CHI3L1-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion from SW480 cells, but p38 inhibitor (SB203580) had no effect (Figure 5B). Transfection of siRNA for ERK or JNK also significantly diminished the protein secretions of IL-8 and MCP-1 from SW480 cells, but siRNA for p38 had no effect (Figure 5B). Together, these results indicate that CHI3L1 induces IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion from colon cancer cells via ERK and JNK, but not p38 pathway.
We further investigated the involvement of MAPK cascade in CHI3L1-induced macrophage chemotaxis and angiogenesis. Incubation with inhibitor for ERK or JNK (PD98059 or SP600125) as well as transfection of siRNA for ERK or JNK significantly diminished the enhanced migration of THP-1 cells and HUVECs induced by CHI3L1 overexpression in SW480 cells in trans-well migration assay (Figure 5C, D). Furthermore, both addition of inhibitor for ERK or JNK (PD98059 or SP600125) and transfection of siRNA for ERK or JNK during preparation of conditioned medium significantly inhibited tube formation of HUVECs induced by conditioned medium from CHI3L1-overexpressed SW480 cells (Figure 5E). In contrast, p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or p38 siRNA did not affect those effects of CHI3L1.
Effect of CHI3L1 in a xenograft mouse model
We further assessed the effect of CHI3L1 on cancer cell proliferation and in tumor microenvironment in vivo. We generated stably transfected HCT116 cells with overexpression of CHI3L1 or control vector using retroviral transduction system. Western blotting showed that protein level of CHI3L1 was up-regulated by CHI3L1 overexpression (Figure 6A). Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with HCT116 cells expressing a control vector in the left flank and a CHI3L1-overexpressed vector in the right flank. Overexpression of CHI3L1 enhanced the tumor growth by 3.5 fold as compared with control during 4 weeks (Figure 6B). To further explore a possible role of CHI3L1 in tumor microenvironment, we stained the serial sections of the implanted tumor with anti-CHI3L1, -F4/80, and -vWF antibodies (Figure 6C). The number of infiltrating F4/80+ macrophages was significantly greater in CHI3L1-overexpressed tumors (Figure 6D). Staining of vWF showed a markedly higher microvessel density (MVD) in CHI3L1-overexpressed tumors (Figure 6E). Thus, we confirmed that CHI3L1 expression was significantly associated with the number of infiltrating macrophages and also with the degree of MVD in a xenograft mouse model.

Discussion
In this study, we showed that CHI3L1 expression was upregulated in cancer cells and has a significant correlation with macrophage infiltration and microvessel density (MVD) in the tumors of human colorectal cancer patients and in a xenograft mouse model. CHI3L1 expression in colon cancer cells significantly promoted the chemotaxis of macrophages and the angiogenesis accompanied by the increased secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1. We further verified that CHI3L1 acted through signal mediators including ERK and JNK to enhance IL-8 and MCP-1 secretions in colon cancer cells.
High serum level of CHI3L1 is detected in patients with several types of cancer and associated with poor prognosis (Cintin et al., 1999; Johansen et al., 2006). In agreement with these early reports, CHI3L1 in the plasma was increased with advancing stage of colorectal cancer. In this study, we confirmed that CHI3L1 was predominantly produced by human colorectal cancer cells rather than infiltrating inflammatory cells by immunohistochemical analysis. CHI3L1 expression in cancer cells was significantly associated with the accumulation of CD68-expressing macrophages and MVD. In addition, we showed a significant correlation between CHI3L1 expression in cancer cells and TN stages as well as lymphatic invasion and vascular invasion. Thus, high expression of CHI3L1 in cancer cells was associated with a more aggressive phenotype with a high metastatic potential.
To clarify the role of CHI3L1 in tumor microenvironment, we utilized human colon cancer cells with macrophages or endothelial cells in trans-well migration and tube formation assays. Interestingly, we observed that up-regulation of CHI3L1 in SW480 cells significantly enhanced migration of THP-1 cells and HUVECs and tube formation of HUVECs. The neutralization of CHI3L1 activity by anti-CHI3L1 Ab and inhibition of endogenously expressed CHI3L1 by CHI3L1-specific miRNAs reduced these chemoattractic effects. These results are consistent with the analysis of clinical samples and strongly suggest that CHI3L1 in cancer cells promotes chemotaxis of macrophages and tumor angiogenesis for the progression of colorectal cancer.
What are the mediators for macrophage chemotaxis and angiogenesis induced by CHI3L1 in cancer cells? The interactions between cancer cells and stromal microenvironments are mainly mediated by inflammatory chemokines (Strieter, 2001; Ben-Baruch, 2006). A recent study showed that MCP-1 plays an important role in angiogenesis as well as chemotaxis of macrophages (Salcedo et al., 2000). IL-8 is also thought to play a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis (Belperio et al., 2000). Therefore, we next examined the possibility that CHI3L1 enhances the release of IL-8 and/or MCP-1 from SW480 cells. As shown in Figure 4, CHI3L1-overexpressed SW480 cells significantly increased the secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1 in a dose-dependent manner as compared with the mock-transfected cells. We further demonstrated that anti-IL-8- or anti-MCP-1- neutralizing antibody significantly suppressed both the macrophage chemotaxis and angiogenesis induced by CHI3L1 overexpression in SW480 cells, suggesting that IL-8 and MCP-1 at least in part mediate the chemotactic and angiogenic actions of CHI3L1 in cancer cells. VEGF is one of the most potent angiogenic factors by inducing endothelial cell migration and tube formation. However, we could not find significant up-regulation of the gene expression of VEGF by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). A previous report showed that an inclusion of the anti-VEGF Ab failed to inhibit the endothelial cell angiogenesis induced by CHI3L1 (Shao et al., 2009). Therefore, CHI3L1 seems to have another angiogenic activity independent of VEGF. Our study indicated a novel mechanism that inflammatory chemokines induced by CHI3L1 promote not only angiogenesis but also macrophage recruitment, while a previous report showed recombinant CHI3L1 has a direct effect on angiogenesis (Shao et al., 2009).
In this study, we also showed that the CHI3L1-induced secretions of IL-8 and MCP-1 were mediated by the activation of MAPK signaling pathway, in particular ERK and JNK but not p38. The inhibition or knockdown of ERK and JNK abrogated migration and tube formation enhanced by CHI3L1, supporting ERK and JNK pathways are predominant downstream effectors in the present study. The NF-kB pathway is also activated by CHI3L1 as our group recently demonstrated (Chen et al., 2011). However, this effect is observed only in the first few hours after stimulation with purified CHI3L1 protein. We could not find significant decrease of the macrophage chemotaxis and angiogenesis by NF-kB inhibitors (BAY11-7082 and BMS-345541) after transfection of CHI3L1 in the present experimental condition (data not shown). As our previous studies suggested the possibility that CHI3L1 can act as a receptor for bacteria on colonic epithelial cells (Mizoguchi, 2006; Kawada et al., 2008), it is interesting to speculate bacteria may activate ERK and JNK signals via CHI3L1.
We further assessed the effect of CHI3L1 on cancer cell proliferation and in tumor microenvironment in in vivo experiment. Consistent with the analysis of clinical samples and in vitro experiments, CHI3L1 expressed in cancer cells significantly enhanced the xenograft tumor growth as well as the recruitment of macrophages and angiogenesis. Our results from both in vitro and in vivo studies strongly supported our hypothesis that CHI3L1 promotes tumor growth not only by the proliferation of cancer cells themselves but also by macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis.
In summary, here we demonstrated that the number of infiltrating macrophages and MVD were significantly associated with CHI3L1 expression both in patients with colorectal cancer and in a xenograft mouse model. We also revealed that CHI3L1 induced IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion through ERK and JNK signal pathways. These inflammatory chemokines appear to mediate macrophage recruitment and tumor angiogenesis to promote colorectal cancer development. Thus, the present study highlighted important roles of CHI3L1 in macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis during cancer development and suggests that targeting of CHI3L1 could be of value for the treatment of human colorectal cancer.
