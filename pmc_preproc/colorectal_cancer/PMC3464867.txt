[Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion]

The TERT variant rs2736100 is associated with colorectal cancer risk. Background: Polymorphic variation at the 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1L) locus is associated with the risk of many cancers but a relationship with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk has yet to be defined.   Methods: We used data from six genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of CRC, linkage disequilibrium mapping and imputation, to examine the relationship between 73 single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 5p15.33 and CRC risk in detail.   Results: rs2736100, which localises to intron 2 of TERT, provided the strongest evidence of an association with CRC (P=2.28 x 10-4). The association was also shown in an independent series of 10 047 CRC cases and 6918 controls (P=0.02). A meta-analysis of all seven studies (totalling 16 039 cases, 16 430 controls) provided increased evidence of association (P=2.49 x 10-5; per allele odds ratio=1.07). The association of rs2736100 on CRC risk was shown to be independent of 15 low-penetrance variants previously identified.   Conclusion: The rs2736100 association demonstrates an influence of variation at 5p15.33 on CRC risk and further evidence that the 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1L) locus has pleiotropic effects (reflecting generic or lineage-specific effects) on cancer risk.

Materials and methods
Ethics
Collection of blood samples and clinico-pathological information from subjects was
undertaken with informed consent and ethical review board approval at all sites in
accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
GWAS datasets
London 1 (LP1) comprised 940 cases with colorectal neoplasia (47% male)
ascertained through the Colorectal Tumour Gene Identification (CoRGI) consortium. All
had at least one first-degree relative affected by CRC and one or more of the following
phenotypes: CRC at age 75 years or less; any colorectal adenoma (CRAd) at age 45 or
less; 3 colorectal adenomas at age 75 or less; or a large (>1 cm
diameter) or aggressive (villous and/or severely dysplastic) adenoma at age 75 years
or less. The 965 controls (45% males) were spouses or partners unaffected by
cancer and without a personal family history (to second-degree relative level) of
colorectal neoplasia. Known dominant polyposis syndromes, HNPCC/Lynch syndrome or
bi-allelic MUTYH mutation carriers were excluded. All cases and controls had
self-reported European ancestry. Both cases and controls were genotyped using Illumina
HumanHap550 BeadChip Arrays (Teo et al,
2007).
Scotland1 (SP1) included 1012 CRC cases (51% male; mean age at diagnosis 49.6
years, s.d.+-6.1) and 1012 cancer-free population controls (51% male; mean
age 51.0 years; s.d.+-5.9). Cases were selected for early age at onset (age
55 years). Known dominant polyposis syndromes, HNPCC/Lynch syndrome or
bi-allelic MUTYH mutation carriers were excluded. Control subjects were sampled
from the Scottish population NHS registers, matched by age (+-5 years), gender and
area of residence within Scotland. Both cases and controls were genotyped using Illumina
HumanHap300 and HumanHap240S arrays (Gunderson et al,
2006; Abraham et al, 2008).
VQ58 (VQ) comprised 1800 CRC cases (1099 males, mean age of diagnosis 62.5 years;
s.d.+-10.9) from the VICTOR and QUASAR2 (http://www.octo-oxford.org.uk/alltrials/infollowup/q2.html) trials.
Genotyping of cases was conducted using Illumina Hap300 and Hap370 arrays (Gunderson et al, 2006; Howarth
et al, 2009). The 2690 controls, typed on the Illumina Human
1.2M-Duo Custom_v1 Array BeadChips, were from the UK population-based 1958 birth cohort,
for which genotype data are publicly available from the Wellcome Trust
Case-Control Consortium 2 (Power and Elliott, 2006;
The Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium, 2007).
The Colon Cancer Family Registry (CFR1) data set comprised 1290 familial CRC cases and
1055 controls CFR (Colon-CFR) (http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/CFR/about_colon.html). The cases were recently
diagnosed CRC cases reported to population complete cancer registries in the United
States (Puget Sound, WA, USA) recruited by the Seattle Familial Colorectal Cancer
Registry; in Canada (ON) recruited by the Ontario Familial Cancer Registry; and in
Australia (Melbourne, VIC) recruited by the Australasian Colorectal Cancer Family Study.
Controls were population-based and for this analysis were restricted to those without a
family history of CRC (Newcomb et al, 2007).
Cases and controls were genotyped using Illumina HumanHap550 and 1M and 1Mduo BeadChip
Arrays.
CFR2 comprised an additional 796 cases ascertained through the CFR (http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/CFR/about_colon.html). Cases were genotyped
using 1M Omni-Express BeadChip Arrays. Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip data on 2304
individuals from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) studies served as
control genotypes (Hunter et al, 2007; Yeager et al, 2007).
The Australian (AUS) study (Tie et al, 2010)
comprised 591 patients treated for CRC at the Royal Melbourne, Western and St Francis
Xavier Cabrini Hospitals in Melbourne from 1999 to 2009. The 2353 controls were derived
from Queensland or Melbourne: for the former, the controls came from the Brisbane Twin
Nevus Study (Duffy et al, 2010); for the latter,
individuals were participants in the Genes in Myopia study (Baird
et al, 2010). There was no overlap between the CFR and Australian
datasets. Both cases and controls were genotyped using Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip
Arrays.
Each of these six GWAS datasets was subjected to extensive quality control procedures.
Specifically, the exclusion of samples and SNPs with call rates <95%,
non-European (CEU) ancestry, relatedness (duplicates or related within or between each
case-control series) and sex discrepancy. Furthermore, there was no evidence of
systematic inflation of the test statistic in any study, as assessed using the genomic
overdispersion factor, lGC, which ranged from 1.00 to
1.04.
Replication series
In total, 10 488 CRC cases, aged <80 years at diagnosis, were ascertained
between March 2003 and October 2011 through the National Study of Colorectal Cancer
Genetics (NSCCG) (Penegar et al, 2007)
(n=9268); the Study of the Genetic Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer
(n=581) and the Royal Marsden Hospital National Health Services Trust
(RMHNHST) family history DNA database (n=639). Controls
(n=7137) were the spouses of cancer cases and were ascertained through
the NSCCG (n=3047); the Genetic Lung Cancer Predisposition Study
(n=1637); the Colorectal Adenoma Gene-Environment Interactions Study
(n=711); the Study of the Genetic Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer
(n=344); and the RMHNHST family history DNA database
(n=1398). None of the controls had a personal history of malignancy at
ascertainment. All subjects were British residents with self-reported European ethnicity
and there were no obvious demographic differences between cases and controls.
Statistical and bioinformatic analysis
A P-value (two-sided)0.05 was considered significant. We applied a
Bonferoni correction to adjust for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were
undertaken using SNPtest/META (The Wellcome Trust Case-Control
Consortium, 2007), and STATA v.10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA)
software. The association between each SNP and risk of CRC was assessed by the
Cochran-Armitage trend test. Odds ratios and associated 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression. Patterns of risk
for associated SNPs were investigated by logistic regression, coding the SNP genotypes
according to additive, dominant and recessive models. We then compared models by
calculating the Akaike information criterion and Akaike weights for each mode of
inheritance.
Interaction between SNP and genotypes was evaluated by likelihood ratio tests comparing
an additive model to a model with an interaction term. Prediction of the non-genotyped
SNPs within the 119.3-kb region of 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1L)
(1 243 475-1 362 793 bps, NCBI build b37) was
carried out using IMPUTEv2 based on the June 2011 release of 1000 Genomes Project data
(Howie et al, 2009, 2011; The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2010). Association testing of genotyped and imputed imputed data were
analysed using SNPTEST v2 to account for uncertainties in SNP prediction. Imputed
genotypes were only called if they had a probability >0.90. Association meta-analyses
only included markers with proper_info scores >0.9, imputed call rates/SNP>0.9
and Hardy-Weinberg>0.01. To condition by SNP, the SNP was added as a covariate.
Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model, estimating Cochran's
Q statistic to test for heterogeneity and the I2
statistic to quantify the proportion of the total variation between studies.
Analysis of LD was performed using the Broad Institute SNP Annotation and Proxy (SNAP)
Search utilising 1000 Genomes Project data. Transcription factor-binding prediction was
performed with TFSearch. Cross-species evolutionary conservation was assessed with the
deCode ECR browser. The UCSC genome browser was used to examine H3K4Me1,
H3K4Me3 and DNase-I hypersensitivity in publicly available cell line
data.
Association between rs2736100 and tumour site (colon-ICD International Classification
of Diseases 9th revision (ICD9)-153; rectal cancer: ICD9-154), Dukes stage (A+B;
C+D), grade (poorly; moderate/well differentiated), sex, age at diagnosis
(55, >55), family history of CRC in a first-degree relative and MSI status was
evaluated by case-only analysis.
Molecular analysis
DNA was extracted from EDTA venous blood samples using conventional methodologies and
PicoGreen quantified (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). We selected 15 SNPs
that have been reported to be associated with CRC from 14 chromosomal regions: rs6691170
(1q41), rs10936599 (3q26.2), rs16892766 (8q23.3), rs6983267 (8q24.21), rs10795668
(10p14), rs3802842 (11q23.1), rs11169552 (12q13.13), rs4444235 (14q22.2), rs4779584
(15q13.33), rs11632715 (15q13.3) rs9929218 (16q22.1), rs4939827 (18q21.1), rs10411210
(19q13.1), rs961253 (20p12.3) and rs4925386 (20q13.33) (Tomlinson
et al, 2007; Houlston et al,
2008; Jaeger et al, 2008; Tenesa et al, 2008; Tomlinson
et al, 2008; Houlston et al,
2010; Tomlinson et al, 2011).
Genotyping of these SNPs and rs2736100 was conducted using KASPar competitive
allele-specific PCR chemistry (KBiosciences Ltd, Hoddesdon, UK; primer sequences and
conditions available on request). To monitor quality control, duplicate samples were
included in assays and a subset of samples sequenced. Concordance between duplicate
samples was (>99%).
Tumour MSI status in CRCs was determined as described previously (Penegar et al, 2007) using the mononucleotide microsatellite loci
BAT25 and BAT26, which are highly sensitive MSI markers. Briefly, 10-mm sections were
cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CRC tumours, lightly stained with toluidine
blue and regions containing at least 60% tumour microdissected. Tumour DNA was
extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the
manufacturer's instructions and genotyped for the BAT25 and BAT26 loci. Samples
showing novel alleles, when compared with normal DNA, at either or both markers were
assigned as MSI-H (corresponding to MSI-high) (Boland et
al, 1998).

Results
Descriptive data
Table 1 provides summary information on the
clinico-pathological characteristics and demographic information on each of the six GWAS
datasets and the replication case-control series.
LD structure of the 5p15.33 region
The six GWA studies of CRC provided genotype data for 12-45 SNPs (depending on
study) mapping to the 119.3-kb region of 5p15.33 in a total of 6007 cases and 9520
controls (Figure 1). To further investigate the relationship
between genetic variation at this region and CRC risk, using 1000 genomes data, we
imputed the genotypes of 22 SNPs not directly genotyped in one or more studies and 45
SNPs not genotyped in any study. Including 6 SNPs directly genotyped in all studies, a
total of 73 SNPs were imputed (Figure 1). In a combined
analysis of these data, the strongest association was shown by the directly typed SNP,
rs2736100 (P=2.28 x 10-4; Figure 1). The per allele OR of CRC associated with rs2736100-T genotype was
1.10 (95% CI:1.05-1.15). The association between rs2853668, a SNP
previously reported to be associated with CRC(Peters et
al, 2012), and CRC risk was non-significant (P=0.06).
To explore the possibility of secondary associations with CRC, we conducted pairwise
conditional analyses of the eight SNPs showing the best evidence for an association with
risk. rs2736100 genotype was shown to be sufficient to capture the 5p15.33 association
with CRC risk (Table 2).
Replication of the rs2736100 association
To provide further independent replication of the rs2736100 association with CRC risk,
we genotyped an additional 10 488 cases and 7137 controls. Genotypes were
obtained for 96% of cases (n=10 047) and 97% of
controls (n=6918) (Table 1). There was no
evidence of population stratification in controls as the genotype distribution satisfied
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=0.76). As with the GWAS data there
was a significant over-representation of the rs2736100-T genotype in CRC cases
(P=0.019; Supplementary Table 1).
Respective ORs of CRC associated with heterozygosity and homozygosity for rs2736100-T
were 1.09 and 1.11, respectively, (Supplementary Table
1). The impact of rs2736100 genotype on CRC was thus comparable to that shown
in the combined analysis of the six GWAS datasets. Although the pattern of risk for CRC
was most parsimonious with a dominant model, a multiplicative model was equally favoured
(P=0.27). To enhance our ability to demonstrate a relationship between
5p15.33 variation and CRC risk, we conducted a combined analysis of all datasets
(Figure 2). In this meta-analysis, the per allele OR was
1.07 (95% CI: 1.04-1.11; P=2.49 x
10-5; Bonferroni-adjusted P-value was 1.82 x
10-3) and there was no evidence for between-study heterogeneity
(Phet=0.7, I2=0%).
Relationship between rs2736100 genotype and phenotype
To explore the relationship between rs2736100 genotype and CRC phenotype, we performed
a case-only analysis using the replication series. This analysis provided no
statistically significant evidence that the CRC association was modified by age, sex, or
family history of CRC (Supplementary Table 1). For 3200
of the cases with known MSI status, rs2736100 genotypes were successfully generated on
2981 (93%), allowing us to calculate CRC risks stratified by MSI status. This
analysis did not provide evidence for a relationship between SNP genotype and MSI status
(Supplementary Table 1).
Interaction between rs2736100 and other common CRC risk variants
Using logistic regression analysis, we tested for an interaction between rs2736100 and
each of 15 SNPs shown previously to be associated with CRC, namely, rs6691170,
rs10936599, rs16892766, rs6983267, rs10795668, rs3802842, rs11169552, rs4444235,
rs4779584, rs9929218, rs4939827, rs10411210, rs961253, rs4925386 and rs11632715. No
evidence of statistical interaction between any of the 15 SNPs and rs2736100 was shown
(Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion
Here we have demonstrated a statistically significant association between rs2736100
genotype and risk of CRC. We have also been able to show that variation at 5p15.33
influences CRC risk independently of other previously identified common risk variants.
This is consistent with a model in which rs2736100 is acting additively with other common
risk variants in mediating CRC susceptibility. As the risk allele of rs2736100 is common,
the variant is likely to underscore ~7% of all CRC in European populations.
Intriguingly rs2736100-T is associated with elevated risk of testicular cancer (Turnbull et al, 2010), but reduced risk of glioma
(Shete et al, 2009), lung adenocarcinoma
(McKay et al, 2008; Wang
et al, 2008) and bladder cancer (Gago-Dominguez et al, 2011). These differential effects of genotype
are likely to be reflective of tumour- and lineage-specific effect.
Although rs2736100 localises to intron 2 of TERT, this does not exclude the
possibility of long-range effects as the functional basis for the 5p15.33 cancer
association. However, although the 5p15.33 locus includes the TERT and
CLPTM1L genes, these essentially map to two distinct regions of LD, making it
likely rs2736100 impacts either directly or indirectly on TERT.
A recent study reported an association between the TERT SNP rs2853668 and CRC
risk (Peters et al, 2012). In our study, rs2736100
provided superior evidence for an association with CRC than rs2853668. As rs2736100 and
rs2853668 are correlated, albeit weakly (r2=0.15,
D'=0.69), it is likely that the association reported by Peters et al, (2012) reflects the impact of rs2736100
genotype, or a hitherto unidentified correlated variant on CRC risk.
Functional variants in TERT have been shown to affect telomerase expression
through modulating promoter activity (Beesley et al,
2011), and such a mechanism offers a possible explanation for how a putative
functional variant at TERT affects CRC risk (Aisner,
2002). Although sequence conservation in non-coding regions has been shown to
be a good predictor of cis-regulatory sequences (Gomez-Skarmeta et al, 2006), there is little evidence for high
conservation directly at rs2736100 (Figure 3). ENCODE project
data does not show evidence for DNAse hypersensitivity sites (indicating open chromatin),
or histone H3KMe1/H3KMe3 methylation (often near regulatory elements) at rs2736100.
Although these data do not support rs2736100 being directly functional, in an analysis of
putative binding sites at rs2736100 using TFSearch, SRY and Hfh-2 sites
are only predicted for rs2736100-T and not rs2736100-G. SRY (sex determining
region Y) is a male-expressed gene involved in sex determination (Wallis et al, 2008). Although speculative, rs2736100-T-mediated
SRY recruitment to TERT might lead to increased expression of
telomerase in germ cells, thereby providing an explanation for the increased risk of
testicular cancer associated with rs2736100-T (Turnbull et
al, 2010). It is unknown whether Hfh-2 (also known as
FOXD3) regulates telomerase expression, however, this forkhead transcription
factor has a role in early cell development, thus suggesting another biological basis for
the 5p15.33 association (Guo et al, 2002). Such
speculations are predicated on the assumption that rs2736100 underscores the 5p15.33
association. Although our imputation provided no evidence for a stronger signal at 5p15.33
than that afforded by rs2736100, it is possible the association is mediated through one or
more rare disease-causing variants, which are not adequately catalogued by the 1000
Genomes project data. High-depth coverage sequencing of a large series of CRC cases for
5p15.33 variation would allow this possibility to be explored.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that polymorphic variation at 5p15.33 is a
determinant of CRC risk. It has recently been shown that polymorphisms in TERC
(telomerase RNA component) are associated with CRC risk and increased telomere length
(Codd et al, 2010; Houlston
et al, 2010; Jones et al,
2012); collectively these data extend the role of genetic variation in
telomere elongation mechanisms in defining cancer risk per se.
