[Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion]

Telomerase is an independent prognostic marker of overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important cause of cancer-related death. Prediction of recurrence is an important issue in the treatment of disease, particularly for stage II patients. The level of telomere-specific reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic component of the telomerase complex, increases along with CRC progression, but its prognostic value is still unclear.   Methods: One hundred and thirty-seven CRC patients were studied for hTERT expression in tumour cells by real-time PCR. hTERT level was evaluated as a prognostic factor of overall survival (OS) in all patients and of disease recurrence in a subgroup of 50 stage II patients.   Results: The median hTERT level was 93.8 copies (interquartile range 48-254). Patients with high hTERT levels (above the median) showed a significantly worse survival than those with low hTERT levels (below the median; log-rank test P<0.0001; hazard ratio (HR)=3.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98-5.52); P<0.0001). The negative prognostic value of high hTERT level is independent of the pathological stage and microsatellite instability (HR=2.09 (95% CI 1.20-3.64), P=0.009). Moreover, in stage II CRC, high hTERT levels identified patients with a higher risk of disease recurrence (HR=3.06 (95% CI 1.03-9.04), P=0.043) and death (HR=3.24 (95% CI 1.37-7.71), P=0.008).   Conclusion: hTERT level is an independent prognostic marker of OS in CRC patients. In addition, assessment of hTERT level could improve stratification of stage II CRC patients for the risk of disease recurrence.

Materials and Methods
Patients
The study population consisted of 137 patients with a diagnosis of CRC who underwent surgery at a single Institution from 1995 to 2005. The surgical specimens, assessed in a standardised way, were reviewed by one pathologist (CM), following the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM stage system, 2010. The initial inclusion criteria of patients were the availability of tumour tissues in which the neoplastic component was at least 80% of cells, the availability of adjacent non-cancerous mucosa and an adequate clinical follow-up (116 patients). Because of interest in defining the prognostic value of hTERT levels in stage II CRC patients, an additional group of 21 patients with stage II CRCs, for whom adequate tumour samples and clinical follow-up were available, was included in the study. Although the study was retrospective, the data were prospectively recorded in an institutional database. At surgery, each patient signed the informed consent approving that biological samples could be stored at our biological bank and used for research purposes.
The MSI status, performed by analysing five microsatellites of the Bethesda recommended panel (BAT-25, BAT-26, D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250) (Pucciarelli et al, 2003), was available for all tumours (Table 1).
Quantification of hTERT transcripts
RNA samples were extracted from cryostat sections of primary tumours using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and were reverse transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript TM III RNase reverse transcriptase assay (Invitrogen) (Terrin et al, 2008). The expression of hTERT transcripts was quantified by real-time PCR using an ABI prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). Absolute quantification was carried out using five-fold dilutions of hTERT amplicon as a reference curve for hTERT copies, and five-fold dilutions of housekeeping hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1) amplicon for HPRT1 copies. Values of hTERT were then normalised for 103copies of HPRT1, as previously reported (Terrin et al, 2008).
Statistical analyses
OS was considered the end-point of the study and was defined as the interval between the date of surgery and the date of death or the last follow-up. DFS was defined as the interval between the date of surgery and the date of disease recurrence. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis was performed by means of the Cox regression model. The proportional hazard assumption was tested using the Grambsch-Therneau method (proportional hazard-test), which is based on Schoenfeld residuals (Therneau and Grambsch, 2000). The Breslow method for handling ties was used while running the Cox model. For univariate analysis, the following prognostic factors were considered: age (years), site of tumours (colon vs rectum), MSI vs microsatellite stability (MSS), pTNM stage (I, II, III, IV) and hTERT levels. hTERT levels were categorised as high (above median value) and low (below median value). The fractional polynomial method was employed to study the functional form of continuous covariates and to relax the linearity assumption of the Cox regression model. The selection of the covariates that significantly and independently contribute to the prognostic model was performed using the stepwise mode. As a measure of overall prognostic accuracy of the final model we calculated the concordance index, which estimates the probability of concordance between predicted and observed events and ranges between 0.5 (no prognostic accuracy) and 1 (perfect prognostic accuracy) (Harrell et al, 1996). OS and DFS empirical curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and the survival functions were compared using the log-rank test. The median follow-up was calculated according to the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. All tests are two-sided, the a-level of significance being set to 5%. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 11 SE (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Results
Characteristics of patients and relationship with hTERT expression
Clinical-pathological characteristics of the 137 CRC patients included in the study are reported in Table 1. Seventy-six patients were males and 61 were females; the median age was 67 years (range, 30-86 years). Tumours were located in the colon in 105 cases (77%) and in the rectum in 32 cases (23%). According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging, 33 tumours were classified as stage I, 50 as stage II, 27 as stage III, and 27 as stage IV. Of the 122 patients for whom data were available, 66 received adjuvant therapy. One hundred and twelve CRCs (82%) had stable microsatellites, whereas 25 CRCs (18%) had MSI. Quantification of hTERT transcripts was obtained for all 137 CRC samples. The median hTERT level was 93.8 (interquartile range 48.0-254.4) copies. In accordance with previous studies (Terrin et al, 2008; Rampazzo et al, 2010), hTERT levels increased with severity of disease. Indeed, median hTERT levels were 52.4 (32.4-121.1), 85.4 (52.8-140.0), 114.52 (65.6-268.1) and 469.2 (210.6-2099.8) copies in tumours stage I, II, III, and IV, respectively (overall, P<0.0001). Furthermore, in agreement with a previous study (Rampazzo et al, 2010), no correlation was found between hTERT levels and MSI or tumour location. Median hTERT levels were 92.3 (62.8-140.0) and 94.3 (44.3-275.0) copies in MSI and MSS CRC, respectively (P=0.68), and 106.1 (54.3-275.1) and 80.3 (36.2-140.1) copies in colon and rectal CRC, respectively (P=0.144).
Relationship of hTERT level with OS of patients
With a median follow-up of 70 months (interquartile range 57-122), the 5-year survival rate was 55.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 46-64). With univariate analysis, TNM stage and hTERT levels were significantly associated with survival (Table 2). The survival curves according to TNM stage are shown in Figure 1A. With regard to hTERT, the study of its functional form suggested that dichotomization by the median value (93.8 copies) would yield a better fit of the survival model; considering this cutoff, patients with high hTERT levels (above the median) showed a significantly worse OS (median 37 months) than those with lower hTERT levels (below the median; (median OS not reached; log-rank test P<0.0001) (Figure 1B). This difference corresponded to a hazard ratio (HR)=3.30 (95% CI 1.98-5.52), P<0.0001.
With multivariate analysis, age, TNM stage, and hTERT were retained in the final regression model (Table 2). The prognostic value of hTERT was maintained even after adjustment for the other covariates (age, site, MSI, pTNM stage), supporting the independent role of this biomarker in predicting the OS of these patients. In particular, the risk of death for patients with high hTERT levels was approximately double that of patients with low levels (HR=2.09 (95% CI 1.20-3.64), P=0.009). The overall prognostic accuracy of the final model was remarkable, as suggested by the high concordance index value (0.78).
Considering the subgroup of 122 patients for whom the chemotherapy data were available, multivariate analysis showed that hTERT level, but not chemotherapy, was significantly associated with OS (HR=2.40 (95%1.14-3.76), P=0.017). The distribution of patients who received chemotherapy did not significantly differ between patients with high or low hTERT levels (Fisher's exact test P=0.102).
Relationship of hTERT level with disease-free and OS of stage II patients
In order to evaluate the role of hTERT as a prognostic factor in patients with stage II CRC, we tested the hypothesis that hTERT might identify patients at high risk in this subgroup. As shown in Figure 2A, stage II patients with high hTERT levels showed a significantly worse median OS (55 months) than those with low hTERT levels (median OS not reached; log-rank test P=0.0048; HR=3.24 (95% CI 1.37-7.71), P=0.008). The median OS of patients with stage II disease and high hTERT levels was very similar to that of patients with stage III disease (55 and 59 months, respectively). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2B, high hTERT levels might identify patients with higher risk of disease recurrence; indeed, patients with high hTERT levels showed a significantly worse median DFS (46 months) than those with low hTERT levels (median DFS not reached; log-rank test P=0.03; HR=3.06 (95% CI 1.03-9.04), P=0.043).
Relationship of MSI with disease-free and OS of patients
Of note, MSI status did not correlate with OS in our cohort of patients (MSI vs MSS): HR=1.08 (95% 0.59-1.98), P=0.802). It has been suggested that MSI defines a subset of patients with stage II tumours with a good prognosis who do not require adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (Sargent et al, 2010). In the stage II patients we studied, 11 had tumours with MSI and 39 with MSS, 15 of whom (4 MSI and 11 MSS) received adjuvant chemotherapy. In this subset of stage II patients neither MSI nor chemotherapy had any significant impact on prognosis in terms of OS (log-rank test P=0.231 and P=0.126, respectively) and DFS (log-rank test P=0.938 and P=0.502, respectively).

Discussion
Pathological tumour staging remains a key determinant of CRC prognosis and treatment. Although radical resection is the primary treatment for patients with loco-regional CRC, adjuvant chemotherapy provides additional survival benefits for patients with stage III tumours. The same benefit has not been conclusively demonstrated in patients with stage II tumours (O'Connor et al, (2011). The controversial results obtained from different studies (Ribic et al, 2003; Benson et al, 2004; Gill et al, 2004; Quasar Collaborative Group, 2007; Sargent et al, 2010) may reflect the molecular heterogeneity of CRCs and highlight the need for strong prognostic markers able to stratify patients.
In the present study, we found that a high level of hTERT is a prognostic marker of shorter OS and its negative prognostic value is independent of pathological stage. In addition, in stage II patients, a high hTERT level identified patients at higher risk of disease recurrence and death.
Several studies have addressed the prognostic value of telomerase expression in CRC, but results are quite controversial. This might be due to the different end-points assessed in these studies, DFS or OS, and the methodology employed to measure the level of hTERT expression or telomerase activity. Most of the studies utilised a semi-quantitative Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol assay to evaluate telomerase activity (Tatsumoto et al, 2000; Kawanishi et al, 2002; Gertler et al, 2004; Garcia-Aranda et al, 2006; Sanz-Casla et al, 2005; Vidaurreta et al, 2007). Only a few studies, using different reference curves and housekeeping genes, employed real-time PCR to evaluate hTERT mRNA values (Gertler et al, 2002; Saleh and Lam 2008; Safont et al, 2011). Furthermore, only one study addressed the prognostic role of telomerase activity in patients with stage II CRCs. Positivity for telomerase activity, estimated by the Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol assay, was associated with a better prognosis and patients with telomerase-positive CRCs had longer DFS than patients with telomerase-negative tumours (Kawanishi-Tabata et al, 2002).
In the present study, the values of hTERT were normalised for expression of the HPRT1 gene, which did not vary according to tumour stage (de Kok et al, 2005), thus allowing a more reliable estimate of hTERT levels in CRCs. Notably, hTERT levels estimated by this approach have been found to be related to telomerase activity in CRCs (Terrin et al, 2008).
Of interest, in our study, we found that hTERT levels significantly stratified stage II patients, regardless of their MSI status. MSI has been reported to be associated with improved DFS compared with MSS; however, no difference in OS was observed between MSI and MSS tumours, and MSI was not predictive of chemotherapy benefit (Kim et al, 2007). Moreover, it has been recently reported that defective DNA mismatch repair, measured by MSI or by loss of MLH1 and MSH2 proteins, is a prognostic marker of DFS; however, its prognostic effect was not maintained in multivariate models (Sargent et al, 2010). In agreement with these studies, our findings do not support the prognostic value of MSI. Indeed, OS did not significantly differ in patients with MSI and MSS tumours. It is of note that in a previous study we found that MSI tumours had shorter telomeres than MSS CRCs, but hTERT expression did not differ (Rampazzo et al, 2010). The present study, in agreement with these findings, did not find a relationship between MSI status and hTERT levels. Notably, the TP53 gene is known to be frequently altered in MSS CRCs. As the p53 is a well-known negative regulator of the hTERT promoter (reviewed in Dolcetti and De Rossi, 2012), mutated p53 may result in an earlier activation of hTERT, with an earlier stabilisation of telomeres, rather than higher levels of hTERT.
Previous studies, indicating that telomerase activity and/or hTERT expression increased along with tumour progression (Malaska et al, 2004; Terrin et al, 2008; Rampazzo et al, 2010; Kojima et al, 2011), have suggested that higher levels of hTERT may compensate for the greater shortening of telomeres due to higher proliferative activity. However, several studies, including ours, did not find a significant relationship between telomere length and telomerase levels and/or activity (Frias and Moran 2009; Rampazzo et al, 2010). Several studies suggested that hTERT might increase the malignant potential of tumours beyond just preservation of telomere length. hTERT might act as a growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic factor, independent of its telomere-elongating activity (Cao et al, 2002; Del Bufalo et al, 2005; Rahman et al, 2005; Massard et al, 2006; Folini et al, 2007; Jin et al, 2010). Our findings that hTERT levels have a prognostic value, regardless of chemotherapy, support the previous in vitro observation that hTERT expression inhibited p53-dependent apoptosis in response to 5-fluorouracil in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells (Rahman et al, 2005). Specific studies are required to investigate the predictive value of hTERT levels in response to specific chemotherapies.
In conclusion, our study strongly indicates that hTERT level is an independent prognostic indicator of survival in patients with CRC. In addition, measurement of hTERT could improve the stratification of stage II patients by the risk of disease recurrence. These effects are likely associated with several functions of hTERT, in addition to its ability to maintain telomere length. Understanding the functions of hTERT is important to deepening the knowledge of CRC pathogenesis and, ultimately, to designing new therapeutic strategies, including hTERT inhibitors.
