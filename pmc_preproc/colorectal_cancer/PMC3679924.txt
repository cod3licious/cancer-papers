Genome-wide association analyses in East Asians identify new susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer. To identify novel genetic factors for colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a genome-wide association study in East Asians. By analyzing genome-wide data in 2,098 cases and 5,749 controls, we selected 64 promising SNPs for replication in an independent set of samples including up to 5,358 cases and 5,922 controls. We identified four SNPs with a P-value of 8.58 x 10-7 to 3.77 x 10-10 in the combined analysis of all East Asian samples. Three of the four SNPs were replicated in a study conducted among 26,060 European descendants with a combined P-value of 1.22 x 10-10 for rs647161 (5q31.1), 6.64 x 10-9 for rs2423279 (20p12.3), and 3.06 x 10-8 for rs10774214 (12p13.32 near the CCND2 gene), respectively, derived from the meta-analysis of data from both East Asian and European populations. This study identified three new CRC susceptibility loci and provides additional insight into the genetics and biology of CRC.

ONLINE METHODS
Study populations
After quality control (QC), 7,456 cases and 11,671 controls from ten studies were included in this consortium (Supplementary Table 2). Detailed descriptions of participating studies and demographic characteristics of study participants are provided in Supplementary Note. Briefly, the consortium included 10,730 Chinese participants, 5,544 Korean participants, and 2,853 Japanese participants. Chinese participants were from five studies: Shanghai Study 1 (Shanghai-1, n = 3,102), Shanghai Study 2 (Shanghai-2, n = 485), Guangzhou Study 1 (Guangzhou-1, n = 1,613), Guangzhou Study 2 (Guangzhou-2, n = 2,892), and Guangzhou Study 3 (Guangzhou-3, n = 2,638). Korean participants were from three studies: the Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II (KCPS-II, n = 1,301), the Seoul Study (n = 1,522), and the Korea-National Cancer Center (Korea-NCC) Study (n = 2,721). Japanese participants were from two studies: Aichi Study 1 (Aichi-1, n = 1,346) and Aichi Study 2 (Aichi-2, n = 1,507). We also evaluated associations for the top four SNPs using data from 11,870 CRC cases and 14,190 controls of European ancestry included in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (GECCO and CCFR), which include 14 studies from the USA, Europe, Canada and Australia 4, 20, 21. Approval was granted from the relevant institutional review boards at all study sites, and all included participants gave informed consent.
Genotyping and QC procedures
For detailed descriptions of genotyping and QC procedures, and design for plates and QC samples, see the Supplementary Note. Briefly, in Stage 1, 481 cases and 2,632 controls from Shanghai-1 were genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 as described previously 14. The average concordance percentage of QC samples was 99.7% with a median value of 100% in Shanghai-1 14, 37, 38. Stage 1 genotyping for 296 cases and 257 controls in Shanghai-2 was performed using Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChips. The same method was used to genotype cases from the Guangzhou-1 (n= 694) and Aichi-1 (n = 497) studies in Stage 1. The positive QC samples in these studies had an average concordance percentage of 99.41% and a median value of 99.97%. Cases and controls in KCPS-II were genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 16. Controls for the Guangzhou-1 and Aichi-1 studies were genotyped previously using the Illumina Human610-Quad 15 and Illumina Infinium HumanHap610 BeadChip 17 platforms, respectively. Details of QC procedures for these samples have been described previously 15-17. Excluded from the analysis were samples that were genetically identical or duplicated, had a genotype-determined sex inconsistent with self-reported data, had unclear population structure, had close relatives with a PI-HAT estimate greater than 0.25 or had a call rate < 95%. Within each study, SNPs were excluded if: 1) MAF < 5%, 2) call rate < 95%, 3) genotyping concordance percentage < 95% in QC samples, 4) P-value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium < 1.0 x 10-5 in controls, or 5) SNPs not in the 22 autosomes. The final numbers of cases, controls, and SNPs remaining for analysis in each participating study are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Genotyping for Stage 2 was completed using the iPLEX Sequenom MassARRAY platform as described previously 14, 39. With the exception of some samples from Guangzhou study, which were genotyped at Fudan University (Shanghai, China), all other samples were genotyped at the Vanderbilt Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory. The average concordance percentage of the genotyping data for positive QC samples was > 99% with a median value of 100% for each of the five studies. SNPs were excluded from the analysis if: 1) call rate < 95%, 2) genotyping concordance percentage < 95% in QC samples, 3) unclear genotyping cluster, or 4) P-value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium < 7.8 x 10-4. The numbers of SNPs remaining for analysis in each participating study in Stage 2 are presented in the Supplementary Note.
Genotyping for samples included in the GECCO and CCFR GWAS was conducted using Illumina BeadChip arrays, with the exception of the Ontario Familial Colorectal Cancer Registry study, for which Affymetrix arrays were used 4, 20, 21. Details of the QC procedures for these samples are presented in the Supplementary Note.
SNP selection for replication
SNPs were selected for Stage 2 replication based on the following criteria: 1) data available in each of the five Stage 1 studies; 2) MAF > 5% in each Stage 1 study; 3) no heterogeneity across the five studies included in Stage 1 (Pheterogeneity> 0.05 and I2< 25%); 4) not in LD (r2< 0.2) with any known risk variants reported from previous GWAS; 5) not in LD (r2< 0.2) with each other; 6) high imputation quality in each of the five studies (RSQ > 0.5), and 7) P< 0.01 in combined analysis of all Stage 1 studies.
Evaluation of population structure
We evaluated population structure in each of the five participating studies included in Stage 1 by using principal components analysis (PCA). Genotyping data for uncorrelated, genome-wide SNPs were pooled with data from HapMap to generate the first ten principal components using EIGENSTRAT software 40 (see URLs). The first two principal components for each sample were plotted using R (see URLs). We identified and excluded one participant of KCPS-II who was more than 6 s away from the means of PC1 and PC2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The remaining 7,847 samples showed clear East Asian origin, and these samples were included in the final genome-wide association analysis. Cases and controls in each of the five studies were in the same cluster as HapMap Asian samples. The estimated inflation factor l ranged from 1.02 to 1.04 in these studies after adjusting for age, sex, and the first ten principal components with a l of 1.01 for combined Stage 1 data (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2).
Imputation
We used the program MACH 1.0 18(see URLs)to impute genotypes for autosomal SNPs which were present in HapMap Phase II release 22 separately for each of the five studies included in Stage 1. Genotype data from the 90 Asian subjects from HapMap were used as reference. For Guangzhou-1 and Aichi-1, cases and controls were genotyped using different platforms. To improve imputation quality 41, we identified SNPs shared between cases and controls (250,612 SNPs in Guangzhou-1 and 232,426 SNPs in Aichi-1) and used them to impute genotyping data. A total of 1,636,380 genotyped SNPs or imputed SNPs with high imputation quality (RSQ > 0.50) in all the five studies were tested for association with CRC. To directly evaluate the imputation quality for the top four SNPs identified in our study, we genotyped them in approximately 2,500 samples included in Stage 1. The agreement of genotype calls derived from direct genotyping and imputation was very high, with a mean value of 98.05%, 95.61%, 99.84%, and 97.90% for rs647161, rs10774214, rs2423279, and rs1665650, respectively (Supplementary Table 7).
Statistical analyses
Dosage data for genotyped and imputed SNPs for participants in each Stage 1 study were analyzed using the program mach2dat 18(see URLs). We coded 0, 1, or 2 copies of the effect allele as dosage for genotyped SNPs, and for imputed SNPs, we used the expected number of copies of the effect allele as dosage score. This approach has been shown to give unbiased estimates in meta-analyses 42. Associations between SNPs and CRC risk were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from logistic regression models. ORs were estimated based on the log-additive model and adjusted for age, sex, and the first ten principal components. PLINK version 1.07 (see URLs) also was used to analyze genotype data 43 and yielded results virtually identical to those derived from dosage data using mach2dat 18. Meta-analyses were performed using the inverse-variance method, assuming a fixed-effects model, and calculations were implemented in the METAL package 19 (see URLs).
Similar to Stage 1, we used logistic regression models to derive ORs and 95% CIs for the 64 selected SNPs in Stage 2, assuming a log-additive model with adjustment for age and sex. We performed joint analyses to generate summary results for combined samples from all studies with additional adjustment for study site. We also conducted stratification analysis for the top four SNPs by population ethnicity (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) and by sex. We used Cochran's Q statistic to test for heterogeneity 44 and I2 statistic to quantify heterogeneity 45 across studies as described elsewhere in detail 46. Analyses for Stage 2, as well as combined Stages 1 and 2 data were conducted using SAS, version 9.2(see URLs), with the use of two-tailed tests. P-value 5x10-8 in the combined analysis was considered statistically significant.
We used Haploview version 4.2 47(see URLs)to generate a genome-wide Manhattan plot for results from the Stage 1 meta-analysis. Forest plots and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots were drawn using R. We drew regional association plots using the website-based tool LocusZoom, version 1.1 48 (see URLs). LD plots were generated using Haploview 47 and UCSC Genome Browser (see URLs).
