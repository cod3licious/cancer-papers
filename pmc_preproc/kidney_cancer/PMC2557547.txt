Survival trends
Relative survival from kidney cancer at 1 year was 58% for men and 54% for women diagnosed during 1986-1990, rising steadily to 65 and 61%, respectively, for those diagnosed during 1996-1999 (Table 1, Figure 1). For patients diagnosed during 1996-1999, 5-year survival had reached 46% in men and women. These changes represent a statistically significant deprivation-adjusted rate of increase of about 3% every 5 years for 1-year survival and 4-5% for 5-year survival. Improvements were slightly more marked in longer-term survival.
Short-term survival predictions, based on hybrid analysis (Brenner and Rachet, 2004) of the conditional probabilities of survival actually observed among men alive at some point during 2000-2001, suggest that survival up to 10 years after diagnosis will continue to improve, but somewhat more slowly, reaching 62-65% at 1 year, 46-47% at 5 years and 39-42% at 10 years, for patients diagnosed in 2000-2001 (Table 1, Figure 1).

Deprivation
Among men, relative survival was systematically higher in more affluent groups, both at 1 year and at 5 years after diagnosis. The fitted difference in relative survival at 5 years between the most affluent and the most deprived groups (the deprivation gap) widened from -3% for those diagnosed in 1986-1990 to -6% for those diagnosed during 1996-1999, a statistically significant change of about -2% every 5 years (Table 2, Figure 2).
For women, in contrast, the deprivation gap in survival at both 1 and 5 years narrowed steadily during the 1990s, and was null or non-significant for those diagnosed during 1996-1999. Figure 2 shows the flattening of the gradient in 5-year survival.
Short-term predictions from hybrid analysis suggest that the deprivation gap in survival up to 5 years is not likely to increase further in the near future, and may fall slightly for men (Table 2).

Comment
Survival from kidney cancer in England and Wales has increased steadily for both sexes during the last three decades. Relative survival at 5 years for patients diagnosed in 1971-1975 was only 30-31%, compared with around 46% for those diagnosed in the late 1990s. The pace of increase in survival has also improved, from around 3% every 5 years during the 1970s and 1980s (Coleman et al, 1999) to around 5% every 5 years in the 1990s, as seen in the data reported here.
Cancer of the kidney is unusual in that it is one of the few cancers for which men have tended to have a small survival advantage over women. Socioeconomic inequalities in survival are notably more marked among men, however, and they increased during the 1990s, whereas those for women have virtually disappeared. The explanation for these patterns is unclear.
Patients excluded from analysis as DCO cases may be biased with respect to survival (Berrino et al, 1995a), but the proportion of DCO cases excluded from analysis was the same in all categories of deprivation throughout the period 1986-1999 in both sexes (data not shown). The socioeconomic differences in survival, and the opposite trends in men and women, are thus unlikely to have been affected by these exclusions.
Five-year survival among patients diagnosed with kidney cancer in England up to the mid-1990s was among the lowest in Europe (Berrino et al, 1995b; Berrino et al, 1999; Berrino et al, 2003). Most of the improvement in survival in England and Wales occurred during the late 1990s, after the period of diagnosis covered by the EUROCARE-3 study (1990-1994).
