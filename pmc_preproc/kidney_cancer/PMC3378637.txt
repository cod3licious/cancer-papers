[Abstract, Methods, Mixed]

Common genetic variants at the 11q13.3 renal cancer susceptibility locus influence binding of HIF to an enhancer of cyclin D1 expression. Though genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified the existence of numerous population-based cancer susceptibility loci, mechanistic insights remain limited, particularly for intergenic polymorphisms. Here we show that polymorphism at a remote intergenic region on chromosome 11q13.3, recently identified as a susceptibility locus for renal cell carcinoma1, modulates the binding and function of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) at a previously unrecognized, transcriptional enhancer of cyclin D1 specific for renal cancers characterized by pVHL inactivation. The protective haplotype impairs binding of HIF-2 resulting in an allelic imbalance in cyclin D1 expression, thus affecting a link between hypoxia pathways and cell cycle control.

Methods
Cell culture - 786-O and MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC. HKC-8 cells were provided by L. Racusen, 786-O cells re-expressing pVHL were a gift from W. G. Kaelin Jr. RCC4 cells were a gift from C.H. Buys, and all other RCC cells were from M. Lerman. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium, 100U/ml penicillin, 100mg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). HKC-8 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2mM L-glutamine, 100U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 5 mg/ml insulin, 5 mg/ml transferring, and 5ng/ml selenium (Sigma). As indicated sub confluent cell cultures were exposed to 1mM dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG, Frontier Scientific) or 1% O2 for 16h prior to harvest.
Tumor samples - were provided by A. L. Harris and collected in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
The chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) were performed on cell lines as previously described19,38, using antibodies against HIF-1a (PM14), HIF-2a (PM9), HIF-1b (Novus Biologicals, NB100-110), RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz SC-899), H3K4me1 (Abcam ab8895), H3K4me3 (Cell signaling 9751), H3K27ac (Abcam ab4729). Pre-immune serum or IgG (Millipore 12-370) were used as negative controls as applicable. For ChIP from tumors snap-frozen tissue was pulverized, resuspended in PBS and fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 12 minutes at 4degC. Cross linking was quenched by addition of 125 mM glycine. After washing in PBS the tissue was lysed in SDS buffer for 15 minutes at room temperature and sheared using an Ultra-Turrax(r). Sonication was carried out as described19 and for each IP the volume of chromatin corresponding to 25 mg of initial tissue weight was used.
High throughput sequencing
Library preparations and sequencing was carried out as described19. Sequences were mapped to NCBI build 36 (hg18) and two-sample peak finding was undertaken using the CisGenome software suite (http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/cisgenome/).
RNA isolation and expression arrays
RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma) and transcribed into cDNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California). Microarray analysis of 786-O cells treated with control siRNA or siRNA targeting HIF-2a or of 786-O/VHL cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia (1% O2) for 16h were carried out in triplicates using Illumina WG6 Bead Chip at the Microarray facility of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford, UK, and values were normalized and filtered for present/absent calls using the Affymetrix software.
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in UREA/SDS buffer and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transferring the proteins onto PVDF membranes HIF proteins were detected using mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1a (BD Bioscience 610958) and anti-HIF-2a (190b) antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Dako).
Formaldehyde - assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE)
Following protocols from Giresi et al.20 an aliquot from cross linked and sonicated ChIP chromatin was used. DNA was extracted with phenol chloroform, precipitated and purified using a PCR product 'clean up' kit (Sigma). qPCR was performed on FAIRE DNA and input DNA in which cross-linking was reversed prior to phenol chloroform extraction. Values were normalized to input DNA and compared to a region just outside of the putative regulatory region (for 11q13.3, hg18 chr11:68948541-68948669; for NDRG1, hg18 chr8:134458206-134458299). Primer sequences are available upon request.
Transfection assays
Transfections of plasmids and a b-galactosidase reporter were performed in 786-O cells using Fugene(r) 6 reagents (Promega). Cells were harvested after 48h and luciferase activity in extracts was measured using a Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Values were normalized to b-galactosidase activity. Sequences were ligated into the Bgl2 restriction site of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega) using PCR amplified genomic DNA from 786-O cells spanning 227bp (hg18 Chr11: 68943675-68943901) of the major peak (H) or 1453bp (hg18 Chr11: 68943675-68945127) including both the major (H) and minor (h1) peaks. Mutations of HREs (RCGTG into RCATA) were performed using site directed mutagenesis. All constructs were sequence verified. Primer sequences are available upon request.
DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization
Fosmids spanning the region of interest were labeled by nick translation with biotin or digoxigenin as previously described39 (CCND1 gene: G248P85537B2, hg18 chr11: 69147108-69190642, HIF-binding site: G248P83053H10, hg18 chr11: 68921622-68961904, 227kb centromeric of HIF-binding site: G248P85591A1, hg18 chr11: 68697196-68733066, 227kb telomeric of gene: G248P89319G2, hg18 chr11: 69380087-69418798). 2D FISH was performed as described previously40 except that slides were denatured at 72degC and probes were denatured at 85degC for 10 min. For each probe pair, inter-probe distances were measured in micrometers using ImageJ software41 in approximately 100 nuclei. 3D FISH was also performed as previously described40 except that cells were permeabilised in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by quenching in 0.276% ammonium chloride in PBS for 10 min at RT. Cells were denatured in a 1 in 4.5 dilution of conc. HCl in milliQ water. Slides were hybridized overnight at 37 degC. Images were captured on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. Z stacks were taken of each nucleus at 400nm steps. For each probe pair, inter-probe distances were measured in micrometers using Zeiss LSM software and nuclear volume measurements in ImageJ software using the Voxel Counter plug-in in approximately 100 nuclei. Non-parametric statistical analysis was by Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVA and by Mann-Whitney U-test (SPSS 19).
Chromatin conformation capture assay
Experiments were performed according to protocols in Hagege et al.42 with some modifications. Cells were grown in 15cm dishes with (MCF-7) or without (786-O) 1mM DMOG for 4h. Cells were cross-linked using 1.5 mM Di(N-succinimidyl) glutarate (Sigma) for 45 min at room temperature followed by 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 10min and quenching by 0.125 M glycine (Sigma). After cell lysis, EcoR1 (New England Biolabs) digest was carried out at 37degC overnight. Fragments were diluted 1:8 in ligation buffer and ligation was carried out for 4 h at 16deg C. Cross-linking was reversed at 65degC overnight and DNA was isolated using phenol chloroform extraction. Digest efficiency was monitored using primers spanning restriction sites and by comparison of digested to non-digested DNA. Chromatin interaction was interrogated using quantitative PCR employing a forward primer and a fluorescence labeled probe located at the first ECOR1 restriction site downstream of the HIF-binding locus (anchor site) combined with reverse primers covering ECOR1 restriction sites across the region of interest. Two BAC clones (RP11 266K14 and RP11 378K8) covering the region of interest were used to create an artificial library of ligation products in order to normalize for PCR efficiency. Data were normalized to the signal from the BAC clone library and, between cell lines, by reference to a region at the EEF1G locus43. Primer sequences are available upon request.
DNA extraction - DNA was extracted from blood samples using DNeasy(r) Blood and Tissue from QuiagenR (Alameda, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA samples were quantified using PicoGreen(r) (Invitrogen).
Allele specific assays - Linkage disequilibrium of SNPs in vicinity of the HIF-binding peaks (rs4980785, rs7948643, rs7939721, rs7939830, rs17136556, rs77247065, rs11263441 with the tag SNP rs7105934 on 11q13.3 and rs4765621 with the tagSNP rs4765623 on 12q24.31) was verified in a cohort of 192 cancer-free control individuals using competitive allele-specific PCR KASPar chemistry (KBiosciences Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK). Haploview software (www.broadinstitute.org) was used to define the haplotype blocks and recombination hotspots. To identify samples heterozygous for the common and rare alleles at rs7105934, rs7948643 and rs77247065, pVHL-defective ccRCC cell lines were genotyped using KASPar. For the heterozygous (1:1 allelic dosage) cell line KTCL140, genomic DNA derived from ChIP or FAIRE (two to three independent biological samples) or cDNA generated from DNAse-treated mRNA were genotyped at rs7948643 and the CCND1 3'UTR SNPs rs7177 and rs678653, using allele-specific Taqman(r) assay (Applied Biosystems). Constitutional DNA from individuals known to be homozygous or heterozygous at each SNP was included in each assay as a reference. All primers, probes and conditions used are available on request. We additionally analyzed allele-specific expression at rs7177 using the method of Lo et al44 which uses one allele as test and the other as reference in a manner analogous to conventional RT-qPCR for mRNA expression levels based on a standard curve. This provided confirmatory evidence of the shift in allelic dosage found by Taqman(r)-based SNP analysis (data not shown). The KTCL140 cell line DNA was also genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress SNP array according to the manufacturer's protocols. The data analysis was performed using Illumina Genomestudio software.
Data analysis
Statistical analyses for FISH measurements were as stated and performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 19 (SPSS Inc). Statistical analyses for FAIRE and ChIP results were performed using a one-sample t-test comparing the mean with a hypothetical value of 1 using GraphPadPrism Version 4.00 (GraphPad Software Inc). All other analyses were conducted using a one-way anova with Dunnett's post-test.
