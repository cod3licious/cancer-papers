Answers
Fibrofolliculomas (multiple pale dome-shaped papules) on the back of her neckAcrochordons (skin fibromas)Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome.
Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease. In 1977, three Canadian physicians reported members of a family with multiple skin trichodiscomas, acrochordons (skin fibromas), and fibrofolliculomas.[1] Affected gene is mapped on the 17 P chromosome.[2] In 2002, Nickerson et al. discovered folliculin gene at this locus.[3] Patients may suffer from pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal tumors.[4]
Multiple or bilateral RCCs most frequently of chromophobe and hybrid oncocytic histology have association with this syndrome, but clear cell and papillary RCC are less frequently found in this syndrome.[567]
