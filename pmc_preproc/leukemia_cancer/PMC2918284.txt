Regulation of myeloid leukemia by the cell fate determinant Musashi. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) can progress from an indolent chronic phase to an aggressive blast crisis phase1 but the molecular basis of this transition remains poorly understood. Here we have used mouse models of CML2,3 to show that disease progression is regulated by the Musashi-Numb signaling axis4,5. Specifically, we find that chronic phase is marked by high and blast crisis phase by low levels of Numb expression, and that ectopic expression of Numb promotes differentiation and impairs advanced phase disease in vivo. As a possible explanation for the decreased levels of Numb in blast crisis, we show that NUP98-HOXA9, an oncogene associated with blast crisis CML6,7, can trigger expression of the RNA binding protein Musashi2 (Msi2) which in turn represses Numb. Importantly, loss of Msi2 restores Numb expression and significantly impairs the development and propagation of blast crisis CML in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Msi2 expression is not only highly upregulated during human CML progression but is also an early indicator of poorer prognosis. These data show that the Musashi-Numb pathway can control the differentiation of CML cells, and raise the possibility that targeting this pathway may provide a new strategy for therapy of aggressive leukemias.

Methods Summary
Mouse models of CML were generated by transducing bone marrow stem and progenitor cells with retroviruses carrying BCR-ABL (chronic phase), or BCR-ABL and NUP98-HOXA9 (blast crisis phase) and transplanted into irradiated recipient mice. The development of CML was confirmed by flow cytometry and histopathology. For Msi2 knockdown experiments, lineage negative blast crisis CML cells were infected with Msi2 or control Luciferase shRNA retroviral constructs and leukemia incidence monitored. ChIP assays were performed using the myeloid leukemia cell line M1. DNA was crosslinked and immunoprecipitated with control or anti-HOXA9 antibodies and analyzed by PCR for regions of interest. CML patient samples were obtained from the Korean Leukemia Bank (Korea), the Hammersmith MRD Lab Sample Archive (United Kingdom), the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (United States) and the Singapore General Hospital (Singapore). Gene expression in human chronic and blast crisis CML was analyzed by PCR or by DNA microarrays.

Methods
Mice
C57BL6/J and BA (C57BL/Ka-Thy1.1) were used as transplant donors, and B6-CD45.1 (B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyJ) and HZ (C57BL/Ka-Thy1.1-CD45.1) mice were used as transplant recipients. All mice were 8-16 weeks of age. Msi2 mutant mice, B6;CB-Msi2Gt(pU-21T)2Imeg, was made and established by genetrap mutagenesis (CARD, Kumamoto University). Floxed Rbpj mice, B6.Cg-Rbpsuhtm3Kyo, were from RIKEN BioResource Center (RBRC01071), and crossed with Vav-cre transgenic mice31,32. Mice were bred and maintained in the animal care facility at Duke University Medical Center. All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Cell isolation and FACS analysis
HSCs were sorted from mouse bone marrow essentially as described31. c-Kit positive cells were enriched by staining whole bone marrow with anti-CD117/c-Kit microbeads and isolating positively labeled cells with autoMACS cell separation (Miltenyi Biotec). For lineage analysis peripheral blood cells were obtained by submandibular bleeding and diluted in 0.5 ml of 10 mM EDTA in PBS. 1 ml of 2% dextran was then added to each sample, and red blood cells depleted by sedimentation for 45 minutes at 37degC. Red blood cells were lysed using RBC Lysis Buffer (eBioscience) before staining for lineage markers. The following antibodies were used to define the lineage positive cells in leukemic samples: 145-2C11 (CD3e), GK1.5 (CD4), 53-6.7 (CD8), RB6-8C5 (Ly-6G/Gr-1), M1/70 (CD11b/Mac-1), TER119 (Ly-76/TER119), and 6B2 (CD45R/B220). Other antibodies used for HSC sorts included 2B8 (CD117/c-Kit) and D7 (Ly-6A/E/Sca-1). All antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen or eBioscience. Analysis and cell sorting were carried out on a FACSVantage SE, FACStar, FACSCanto II, or FACSDiva (all from Becton Dickinson) at the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Core Facility, and data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).
Retroviral constructs and production
MIG-BCR-ABL was cloned into MSCV-IRES-YFP or -CFP retroviral vector. MSCV-NUP98-HOXA9-IRES-YFP was cloned into the MSCV-IRES-tNGFR vector. Numb cDNA (p65 isoform, NCBI Accession number BC033459) was cloned into the MSCV-IRES-GFP vector. Msi2 cDNA (IMAGE clone ID 40045350) was purchased from Open Biosystems, and its protein coding region was cloned into MSCV-IRES-GFP or -CFP. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs were designed and cloned in MSCV/LTRmiR30-PIG (LMP) vector from Open Biosystems according to their instructions. The target sequences are 5'-CCCAGATAGCCTTAGAGACTAT-3' for Msi2 and 5'-CTGTGCCAGAGTCCTTCGATAG-3' for firefly luciferase as a negative control. MSCV-IRES-CFP with Msi2 mutant cDNA resistant to shMsi was constructed by inverse PCR strategy using primers with silent mutations (underlined) in the shMsi target sequence; 5'-CCTGACTCTCTGAGGGACTATTTTAGCAAATTTGG-3'. Lentiviral shRNA construct with the alternate Msi2 target sequence, 5'-AGTTAGATTCCAAGACGA-3', was cloned in FG12 as described previously33. Virus was produced in 293T cells transfected with viral constructs along with gag-pol, VSV-G and Rev (in case of FG12) constructs. Viral supernatants were collected for three to five days and concentrated by ultracentrifugal at 50,000xg for 3h.
In vitro methylcellulose colony formation assays
Lineage negative (Lin-), NUP98-HOXA9-IRES-YFP positive cells from blast crisis CML were sorted and infected retrovirally with either Vector-IRES-GFP or Numb-IRES-GFP. After 48 hours of infection, cells were sorted and serially plated in complete methylcellulose medium (Methocult GF M3434 from StemCell Technologies). For knockdown experiments, Lin- population in blast crisis CML were sorted and infected with the indicated retroviruses for 48h. Infected cells were sorted based on their fluorescent protein expression and plated as above. Colonies were counted 5-7 days after plating.
Generation and analysis of leukemic mice
Bone marrow c-Kit+ or KLS cells were sorted and cultured overnight in X-Vivo15 media (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum, stem cell factor (SCF, 100 ng/ml, R&D Systems), and thrombopoietin (TPO, 20 ng/ml, R&D Systems). Subsequently, cells were infected with the retroviruses. Viruses used were as follows: MSCV-BCR-ABL-IRES-YFP (or CFP or GFP) to generate chronic phase leukemia, or MSCV-BCR-ABL-IRES-YFP (or CFP or GFP) and MSCV-NUP98-HOXA9-IRES-YFP (or tNGFR) to generate blast crisis CML. Cells were harvested 48 hours after infection and transplanted retro-orbitally into groups of B6-CD45.1 mice. Recipients were lethally irradiated (10Gy) for chronic phase leukemia, and sublethally (7Gy) or non-irradiated for blast crisis CML. For Numb overexpression, cells were infected with either MSCV-Numb-IRES-GFP or MSCV-IRES-GFP along with MSCV-BCR-ABL-IRES-YFP (or CFP) and MSCV-NUP98-HOXA9-IRES-tNGFR (or YFP) and 20,000 to 100,000 infected cells were transplanted per mouse. For secondary transplantation, cells from primary transplanted mice were sorted for either MSCV-Numb-IRES-GFP and MSCV-NUP98-HOXA9-IRES-YFP or MSCV-IRES-GFP and MSCV-NUP98-HOXA9-IRES-YFP, and 7,000 to 8,000 cells were transplanted per mouse. For Msi2 knockdown by retroviral shRNA transduction, Lin- population from blast crisis CML were sorted and infected with either control shLuc (against luciferase) or shMsi (against Msi2) retrovirus for 48h. Infected cells were sorted based on their GFP expression, and 1,000 to 3,000 cells were transplanted in sublethally irradiated B6-CD45.1 recipients. After transplantation, recipient mice were maintained on antibiotic water (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) and evaluated daily for signs of morbidity, weight loss, failure to groom, and splenomegaly. Premorbid animals were sacrificed and relevant tissues were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry and histopathology.
Immunofluorescence staining
For immunofluorescence, relevant leukemic cell populations were sorted, cytospun and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes. Samples were then blocked using 20% normal donkey serum in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, and stained at 4degC overnight with an antibody followed by Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular probe) and DAPI. Slides were mounted using mounting media (Fluoromount-G SouthernBiotech) and viewed on the Axio Imager (Zeiss). Antibodies used were as follows: anti-Numb, Ab4147 (Abcam) or C29G11 (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-p53, DO-1 (Thermo Scientific); anti-cleaved Notch1, Val1744 (Cell Signaling). Fluorescence intensity was analyzed using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
To identify potential HOX binding sites in the Msi2 gene upstream promoter region, we employed an algorithm ConCise Scanner34 using a combination of the following matrices V$HOXA9.01, V$HOXB9.01, V$PBX_HOXA9.01, V$HOX_PBX.01, V$MEIS1A_HOXA9.01 and V$MEIS1B_HOXA9.01. The myeloid leukemia cell line M1 was maintained in RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1x107 cells were subjected to DNA-protein cross-linking. ChIP assays were performed according to a modified protocol based on ChIP-IT Express kit (Active Motif). PCR primer sequences are as follows; for Msi2 (-5.7kb site), 5'-TGGACAGCCTCATCCACAGAGCA-3' and 5'-ACTGTGCTACATTCCCAGCCGCT-3'; for Msi2 (+110kb site), 5'-GTTCTTAGCTGCCTCTCTCAGA-3' and 5'-GAACAATGTCTCTGTCAGGCCT-3'; for Flt3, 5'-AGTCAGAAGGGACTGGCTCC-3' and 5'-GAGTGCTGCTTAGCAGATTACC-3'.
b-galactosidase reporter gene assays
KLS cells were isolated from Msi2 genetrap heterozygote bone marrow and infected with MSCV-BCR-ABL-IRES-YFP and MSCV-NUP98-HOXA9-IRES-GFP. GFP and YFP double positive cells were sorted 48 hours after infection, and cultured in X-Vivo15 media supplemented with SCF and TPO as described. After 4 days, cells were harvested in reporter lysis reagent, and b-galactosidase activities were analyzed by using b-Gal reporter gene assay, Chemiluminescent (Roche Diagnostics).
Realtime and standard RT-PCR analysis
RNA was isolated using RNAqueous-Micro (Ambion), equal amounts of RNAs were converted to cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative realtime PCRs were performed using an iCycler (BioRad) by mixing cDNAs, iQ SYBRGreen Supermix (BioRad) and gene specific primers. Results were normalized to the level of beta-2 microglobulin (B2m, mouse) or beta-actin (ACTB, human). Primer sequences are as follows: Numb-F, ATGAGTTGCCTTCCACTATGCAG; Numb-R, TGCTGAAGGCACTGGTGATCTGG; Msi1-F, ATGGATGCCTTCATGCTGGGT; Msi1-R, CTCCGCTCTACACGGAATTCG; Msi2-F, TGCCATACACCATGGATGCGT; Msi2-R, GTAGCCTCTGCCATAGGTTGC; B2m-F, ACCGGCCTGTATGCTATCCAGAA; B2m-R, AATGTGAGGCGGGTGGAACTGT; MSI2-F, GTTATCTGCGAACACAGTAGTG; MSI2-R, ACCCTCTGTGCCTGTTGGTAG; ACTB-F, AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA; ACTB-R, AATGCTATCACCTCCCCTGTGT. Human HES1 (Hs00172878_m1) and TRIB2 (Hs00222224_m1) gene levels were analyzed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays.
Human leukemia specimens and microarray gene expression studies
Chronic and blast crisis CML samples were obtained from the Korean Leukemia Bank (Seoul, Korea), the Hammersmith MRD Lab Sample Archive (London, United Kingdom), the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, United States) and the Singapore General Hospital (Singapore) from Institutional Review Board approved protocols with written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Gene expression profiles of CML patient samples have been described previously35. This published data set has been reanalyzed to examine expression of MSI2, NUMB, HES1, and HOXA9 in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 42 chronic phase, 17 accelerated phase and 31 blast crisis CML patients. The procedures for RNA extraction, amplification, labeling, and hybridization, as well as statistical analysis methods for the Rosetta platform are as previously published35. GenePlus(tm) software (Enodar Biologic, Seattle, WA) was used to determine differential expression between groups (i.e. by disease phase); p-values were calculated using gene-by-gene ANOVA and estimating equation techniques were used to calculate the number of false discoveries (NFD)36.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was carried out using the R language version 2.6.2 (http://www.r-project.org/) and GraphPad Prism software version 4.0c (GraphPad software Inc.).
