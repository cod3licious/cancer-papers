[Abstract, Methods, Mixed]

Mutant nucleophosmin and cooperating pathways drive leukemia initiation and progression in mice. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly diverse malignancy with a poor prognosis, whose largest subgroup is characterized by somatic mutations in NPM1, the gene for Nucleophosmin1. These mutations, termed NPM1c, result in cytoplasmic dislocation of Nucleophosmin1 and are associated with distinctive transcriptional signatures2, yet their role in leukemogenesis remains obscure. Here we report that activation of a humanized Npm1c knock-in allele in murine hemopoietic stem cells causes Hox overexpression, enhanced self-renewal and expanded myelopoiesis. One third of mice developed delayed-onset AML, suggesting a requirement for cooperating mutations. We identified such mutations using a Sleeping Beauty3-4 transposon which caused rapid-onset AML in 80% of Npm1c+ mice, associated with mutually exclusive integrations in Csf2, Flt3 or Rasgrp1 in 55 of 70 leukemias. Recurrent integrations were also identified in known and novel leukemia genes including Nf1, Bach2, Dleu2 and Nup98. Our results give new pathogenetic insights and identify therapeutic targets in NPM1c+ AML.

Methods
Primers/Oligonucleotides
For all sequences see Supplementary table 9
Transient transfections
Amino-terminal GFP-NPM1/GFP-Npm1 fusion constructs were generated and K562 cells photographed 24hrs after electroporation.
Npm1flox-cA/+ ES cells and mice
A 9.8kb was retrieved from BAC bMQ-282D14 using oligonucleotide recombineering29 and modified to the Npm1flox-cA targeting construct (duplicated region: NCBIM37-chr11:33051153-33053141). Npm1cA (Post-Cre) ES cell clones were derived under FIAU selection30. Npm1flox-cA/+ and Npm1flox-cA/flox-cA mice were crossed with Stella-Cre for embryonic viability and Mx1-Cre31 mice for hemopoietic studies. For Mx1-Cre activation 500mg pIpC x6 was used.
Stella-Cre mice
Generated by WW and PL by insertion of IRES-Cre into the 3'UTR of Stella, they show 100% Cre-loxP recombination at several loci in embryos and germline.
GrOnc mice
Generated by pronuclear injection of linearized GrOnc DNA.
Rosaflox-SB transposase mice
Generated as per Supplementary Figure 6.
Mouse genotyping
We used PCR assays with primers P1-P16 (e.g. Supplementary Figures 2, 6, 7).
Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting
Mouse femurs and spleens were processed as described32. For BM lineage analysis we stained with Gr1-PE and CD11b(Mac1)-FITC, or B220-APC-Alexa750 and CD19-PE. For HSC/progenitor analyses, we depleted lineage-positive cells using MACS columns and stained with cKit-APC, ScaI-PB, CD34-FITC and either Flt3-PE (HSC) or FcRIII-PE (progenitors). Antibodies from BD Pharmingen except CD11b-FITC (Caltag). We used a CyAn-ADP analyzer and FlowJo. B220+ and Gr1+/Mac1+ cells were sorted using a MoFlo sorter. For leukemia phenotyping we used combinations of the above.
Gene expression profiling
Global profiling was done using Illumina mouse-6 expression beadchip version 2. Data were quantile normalised33 and analyzed using the bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/), lumi (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.0/bioc/html/lumi.html) and limma34 packages, then p-value adjusted for multiple testing35. Microarray data and description of experimental design were deposited to Array Express with accession number E-MEXP-3113.
Hemopoietic colonies
BM or spleen cells were plated in M3434 (Stem Cell Technologies) as described33. Colonies were counted/picked after 10-12 days. For re-plating assays 50,000 BM cells from 6xNpm1cA/+ and 6xNpm1WT mice were plated and counted after 8 days with 30,000 cells re-plated etc.
Southern Blots
Npm1 targeting: PstI-digested ES cell DNA was hybridized with a PCR-generated-probe (Figure 1b). GrOnc copy number and clonal integrations: SacI-digested tail DNA or BamHI-digested leukemic DNA respectively, were hybridized with the XbaI-SacII GrOnc fragment (Supplementary Figure 5).
RT-PCR
For Npm1+ and Npm1cA cDNAs we used allele-specific primers R1-R3 and for GrOnc-Csf2 primers Graffi1.4-LTR_F and Csf2_exon3_R.
qPCR/qRT-PCR
For GrOnc copy number En2-SA and b-Actin were quantified from tail DNA. En2-SA/b-Actin ratio was normalized against wild-type mice (2 copies of En2-SA). For Csf2 qRT-PCR we designed specific primers/probe and normalized against Gapdh. For Hox genes, we used standardized assays (Applied Biosystems), normalized against Gapdh and expressed values relative to Npm1+/+.
Anti-Npm1cA specific antisera and Western Blots
Anti-Npm1cA-specific rabbit antisera, were generated and affinity-purified using peptide Hydrazine-IQDLCLAVEEVSLRK and used at 1/100. Mouse monoclonal anti-Actin (Sigma) was used at 1/5000.
FISH analysis
The location of the 80-copy GrOnc donor site, was identified using Texas Red-labeled GrOnc DNA on blood metaphases.
Hematological measurements
Blood counts were performed on a VetABC analyzer (Horiba ABX).
Splinkerette PCR and sequencing
These were done as described36 using SB-specific primers and 454-sequenced.
Identification of common integration sites (CISs)
ssaha2 was used to map GrOnc insertions to mouse genome. Sequences were filtered to contain the SBcommon-Sp2-454R primer then the end of the SB repeat, followed by genomic sequence starting with TA and ending at GATC (MboI restriction site). Sequences <17 nucleotides or with <85% maximal genomic identity were discarded. For sequences matching several loci, we calculated a normalized score difference (NSD) comparing the best hit to the second best hit, whereby NSD= ((score of best hit) - (score of second-best hit)) / query-length*100. We mapped 5000 random mouse genomic fragments to the genome and found that 96.5% of correctly and only 1.5% of wrongly mapped reads had NSD >=4 and removed reads with NSD <4 from analysis. Finally, redundant sequences from the same tumor and same location were "collapsed" to one integration. To identify CISs, non-redundant insertions were analyzed using a Gaussian Kernel Convolution-based framework37 for 10Kb, 30Kb, 60Kb and 120Kb windows and all windows merged to compile CIS lists38. To identify previously described CISs we searched the retroviral tagged cancer gene database (RTCGD, http://rtcgd.ncifcrf.gov)36 and recent insertional mutagenesis publications3-4,39-40.
Histopathology
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with H&E and anti-CD3, anti-B220 and anti-myeloperoxidase, detected by immunoperoxidase. All material was examined by two experienced histopathologists (PW and MA) blinded to mouse genotypes. A primary diagnosis was established and hemopoietic tissues examined for additional malignancies.
Gm-csf ELISA
Cryopreserved AML cells were plated in duplicate at 100,000 per 100ul RPMI/ 10%FCS. Supernatants were collected after 2 days and assayed (EMGMCSF, Thermo).
Leukemia Transplants
Syngeneic mice were sublethally irradiated (500rad) and injected with 1x106 cryopreserved AML cells into the tail vein. Mice were culled when unwell or after 180 days.
Statistics
We used Fisher's exact test for 2x2 comparisons and mutual exclusivity testing, kh2-test for nominal data and t-test for continuous data unless normality test failed, when Mann-Whitney Rank Sum tests were used (Sigma Stat). SEMs are represented in error bars.
