[Abstract, Methods, Methods, Mixed]

A novel tumor suppressor function for the Notch pathway in myeloid leukemia. Notch signaling is a central regulator of differentiation in a variety of organisms and tissue types1. Its activity is controlled by the multi-subunit g-secretase complex (gSE) complex2. Although Notch signaling can play both oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles in solid tumors, in the hematopoietic system, it is exclusively oncogenic, notably in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a disease characterized by Notch1 activating mutations3. Here we identify novel somatic inactivating Notch pathway mutations in a fraction of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients. Inactivation of Notch signaling in mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) resulted in an aberrant accumulation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP), extramedullary hematopoieisis and the induction of CMML-like disease. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Notch signaling regulates an extensive myelomonocytic-specific gene signature, through the direct suppression of gene transcription by the Notch target Hes1. Our studies identify a novel role for Notch signaling during early hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and suggest that the Notch pathway can play both tumor-promoting and suppressive roles within the same tissue.

METHODS SUMMARY
Animals
All mice were kept in specific pathogen-free animal facilities at the New York University School of Medicine. Mx1-Cre+ animals were injected with 20ug polyI:polyC/gram of body weight for a total of 3 injections. The injections were initiated 14 days after birth and done every two days. Animals were analyzed 4-6 weeks after the last injection unless indicated otherwise. All animal experiments were done in accordance to the guidelines of the NYU School of Medicine IACUC.
Antibodies and FACS analysis
Antibody staining and FACS analysis was performed as previously described22. All antibodies were purchased from BD-Pharmingen or e-Bioscience. We used the following antibodies: c-kit (2B8), Sca-1 (D7), Mac-1 (M1/70), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), NK1.1 (PK136), TER-119, CD3 (145-2C11), CD19 (1D3), IL7Ra(A7R34), CD34 (RAM34), FcgRII/III (2.4G2), Flk-2/Flt-3 (A2F10.1), CD4 (RM4-5), CD4 (H129.19), CD8 (53-6.7), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD150 (9D1), CD48 (HM481). Bone marrow lineage antibody cocktail includes: Mac-1, Gr-1, NK1.1, TER-119, CD3, CD19.
OP9-DL1/DL4 in vitro coculture
OP9-DL1 cells were maintained in MEM additioned of 10% Foetal Bovine Serum. 10 x 103 purified infected (GFP+) LSK or cKit+ BM progenitors were seeded into a 6-well plate with confluent OP9 cells in the presence of 10ng/ml SCF, 10ng/ml IL3, 5 ng/ml Flt3-L and 5 ng/ml Il-7. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a LSRII (BDIS). Hematopoietic cells were gated using CD45 cell surface expression.
Microarray analysis
LSK or GMP cells from individual mice were used. In order to generate sufficient sample quantities for oligonucleotide gene chip hybridization experiments, we used the Ovation(r) RNA Amplification System V2 (Nugen) for cRNA amplification and labeling. The amplified cRNA was labeled and hybridized to the Mouse 430.2 microarrays (Affymetrix). The data was normalized using the previously published Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm using the GeneSpring GX software (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA).

Methods
Animals
Genotyping of N1f/f N2f/f N3-/- mice 23-26 was performed as previously reported. Ncstnf/fMx1-Cre+ and N1f/fN2f/fN3-/- Mx1-Cre+ animals were injected with 20ug polyI:polyC/gram of body weight for a total of 6 injections. The injections were initiated 14 days after birth and done every two days. Animals were analyzed 4-6 weeks after the last injection unless indicated otherwise. All animal experiments were done in accordance to the guidelines of the NYU School of Medicine IACUC.
Generation of the Ncstnf/f mice
To generate a conditional Ncstn allele we have used standard ES cell targeting approaches. Exons 5-7 of the Ncstn locus were targeted for Cre-dependent recombination. Removal of these exons generates an in-frame stop codon that prematurely terminates translation. As homology region we used a 7 Kb BsrGI-EcoRI genomic fragment that spans introns 2-11. A PGK-NEO cassette and a loxP site were cloned into an EcoRV site located in intron 4, while the second loxP site was subcloned into a unique PmlI site of intron 7. Embryonic stem (ES) cell colonies (129/sj) were screened by Southern blot of genomic DNA digested with BamHI (Figure 1B). Correctly targeted ES cells were injected in C57BL6 blastocysts and chimeras were generated. After verification of germline transmission the PGK-NEO cassette was removed using a germline Flp mouse 27. Ncstnf/fFlp+ mice were crossed to the Mx-cre strain. Genotyping primers and probes are available upon request.
Antibodies and FACS analysis
Antibody staining and FACS analysis was performed as previously described 22. All antibodies were purchased from BD-Pharmingen or e-Bioscience. We used the following antibodies: c-kit (2B8), Sca-1 (D7), Mac-1 (M1/70), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), NK1.1 (PK136), TER-119, CD3 (145-2C11), CD19 (1D3), IL7Ra(A7R34), CD34 (RAM34), FcgRII/III (2.4G2), Flk-2/Flt-3 (A2F10.1), CD4 (RM4-5), CD4 (H129.19), CD8 (53-6.7), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), CD150 (9D1), CD48 (HM481). Bone marrow lineage antibody cocktail includes: Mac-1, Gr-1, NK1.1, TER-119, CD3, CD19. For western blotting goat polyclonal anti-Nicastrin antibody ( N19, sc-14369, Santa Cruz) and mouse monoclonal anti-Actin antibody (Clone C4, MAB1501R, Millipore) were used. Annexin V/7AAD staining was done using AnnexinV PE detection kit (BD Pharmingen, 559763) following manufacturer's protocol.
RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript First-Strand Kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green iMaster and a LightCycler 480 (Roche) using the following primer sequences (Tm=60degC used for all primers): Cebpa Forward TTACAACAGGCCAGGTTTCC, Cebpa Reverse CTCTGGGATGGATCGATTGT, Pu.1 Forward ATGGAAGGGTTTTCCCTCACCGCC, Pu.1 Reverse GTCCACGCTCTGCAGCTCTGTGAA, Gata2 Forward AACGCCTGTGGCCTCTACTA, Gata2 Reverse TCTCTTGCATGCACTTGGAG, Cebpd Forward ATCGCTGCAGCTTCCTATGT, Cebpd Reverse AGTCATGCTTTCCCGTGTTC, Hes1 Forward TCCAAGCTAGAGAAGGCAGAC, Hes1 Reverse TGATCTGGGTCATGCAGTTG, Gata1 Forward ACTGTGGAGCAACGGCTACT, Gata1 Reverse TCCGCCAGAGTGTTGTAGTG, Ncstn Forward CTGGCGCGTGCACTGTATGAG, Ncstn Reverse GGAGACGGCGATGTAGTGTTGAAG.
Bone marrow transplantation assays
5x105 bone marrow cells (Ly5.2+) were transplanted by retro-orbital i.v. injections into lethally irradiated (960 cGy) BL6SJL (Ly5.1+) recipient mice. 4 weeks after transplant mice were injected with 20ug polyI:polyC per gram of body weight for a total of 6 injections. Peripheral blood of recipient mice was collected at 4, 7, 9 and 12 weeks after transplant. Recipient mice were sacrificed 16 weeks after transplant for analysis.
Microarray analysis
LSK or GMP cells from individual mice were used. Microarray analysis was performed as previously described 28. Briefly, freshly isolated cells were sorted by surface marker expression, and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, CA). In order to generate sufficient sample quantities for oligonucleotide gene chip hybridization experiments, we used the Ovation(r) RNA Amplification System V2 (Nugen) for cRNA amplification and labeling. The amplified cRNA was labeled and hybridized to the Mouse 430.2 microarrays (Affymetrix). The Affymetrix gene expression profiling data was normalized using the previously published Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm using the GeneSpring GX software (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The gene expression intensity presentations were generated with Matrix2png software (http://chibi.ubc.ca/matrix2png/bin/matrix2png.cgi) or Multi Experiment Viewer software (http://www.tm4.org/mev/).
GeneSet Enrichment Analysis
Geneset Enrichment Analysis was performed using GSEA software 29,30, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/, using Gene set as permutation type, 1000 permutations and log2 ratio of classes as metric for ranking genes.
The "Myeloid Signature" geneset was generated using a systematic approach based on the comparison of gene expression arrays from WT LSK and WT GMP. Genes that were significantly upregulated in GMP compared to LSK (over 1.5 fold induction p-value<0.05) were used to define myeloid signature genes. The list was trimmed of unknown function genes and genes related to metabolism.
Other myeloid specific Genesets used in the analysis were taken from genesets already present in the MSig Database of the Broad Institute.
Retroviral infection of LinegaenegcKit+ bone marrow cells or LSK cells
Bone marrow cells were enriched for cKit-positive cells using either the EasySep kit (StemCell Technology) or the Dynabead kit (DYNAL, Invitrogen). LSK cells were flow sorted using lineage marquers Mac-1, Gr-1, NK1.1, TER-119, CD3, CD19, Sca1 and cKit. Cells were subsequently cultured in OPTI-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 50 ng/ml of SCF and Flt3l, 10 ng/ml of IL6 and IL7. For retroviral production, Plat-E cells were transfected with appropriate retroviral expression constructs by calcium phosphate method. Virus supernatant was collected 48 hr post transfection and used directly for spin infection of cKit positive-enriched bone marrow cells or sorted LSK cells at 2500 rpm for 90 minutes. Forty-eight hours after infection, lineage-negative GFP-positive cells were sorted for RT-PCR analysis, methylcellulose pating assays or OP9 coculture assay.
In vitro differentiation assays
Total bone marrow (15,000), sorted LSK (500) and GMP (500) were plated in triplicates into cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium (MethoCult 3434, Stem Cell Technologies). Colony type was scored after 10 days of culture. Replating was performed after 8 days of culture. For experiments involving Hes1 over-expression 10,000 GFP+ infected cells were plated in duplicate on 35mm cytokine-supplemented methylcellulose medium (MethoCult 3434, Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were recovered 8 days later, stained and analyzed by FACS as described.
Human progenitor/OP9 cocultures
BM samples were obtained and used according to the guidelines of the Medical Ethical Commission of Ghent University Hospital (Belgium). BM mononuclear cells were isolated through Lymphoprep density-gradient centrifugation and CD45+ glycophorin-A positive (Gly-A+) cells were enriched via micro-magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Subsequently, CD45+Gly-A+ cells were labelled with CD34-FITC, CD38-PE, CD19-APC and CD14-APC to sort CD34+CD38-Lin- cells on a FACSAria to a purity of 0>98%. OP9-control and OP9 cells expressing human ligands Dll1, Dll4, Jag1 and Jag2 were generated by retroviral transduction of OP9 cells (kindly provided by J.C. Zuniga-Pflucker), followed by sorting for eGFP+ cells, as described previously31. 2.0 - 2.6 x 103 purified BM progenitors were seeded into a 24-well plate with confluent OP9 cells in the presence of 20 ng/ml SCF, 20 ng/ml Flt-3L, 20 ng/ml TPO, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF and 10 ng/ml G-CSF. Cocultures were performed and prepared for analysis as described previously32. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a LSRII (BDIS). Human cells were gated using a CD45 monoclonal antibody and dead cells were excluded using propidium iodide.
OP9-DL1/DL4 in vitro coculture
OP9 cells were maintained in MEM additioned of 20% Foetal Bovine Serum. 10 x 103 purified infected (GFP+) LSK or cKit+ BM progenitors were seeded into a 6-well plate with confluent OP9 cells in the presence of 10ng/ml SCF, 10ng/ml IL3, 10ng/ml IL6, 5 ng/ml Flt3-L and 5 ng/ml Il-7. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a LSRII (BDIS). Hematopoietic cells were gated using CD45 cell surface expression and GFP expression.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed with 80ug of genomic DNA from 32D-MIG-infected or 32D-HES1-infected cells following standard procedures. Briefly, chromatin was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and sheared by sonication. Immunoprecipitation was performed with IgG or anti-HES1, followed by incubation with protein A magnetic beads/salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen Dynal AS,Oslo, Norway). DNA isolated from antibody bound fraction was eluted after wash, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Real-time PCR quantification of immunoprecipitated DNA was carried out with the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Roche) and primers designed to amplify regions covering each putative HES1 binding site in the Pu.1 and Cebpa promoters: Pu.1-1 For ACGTTCAAGGGTTGGAGAAA, Pu.1-1 Rev GCCAATTAGGGCCAACAGTA, Pu.1-2 For GACCAAAGTCCTCCACCTGA, Pu.1-2 Rev CTGGGAGGGAGAAAGGCTA, Cebpa-1 For CCAAAGCAGTCTCCAACCTC, Cebpa-1 Rev CCCACTTCCAGCCAACACTA, Cebpa-2 For CGCCTAACCACGGACCAC, Cebpa-2 Rev AGTAGGATGGTGCCTGCTG.
Histological Analyses
Mice were killed and autopsied, and then dissected tissue samples or tumors were fixed for 24 h in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 5 um and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Luciferase reporter assays
pGL3 promoter reporter plasmid (Promega) was used to clone Pu.1, Cebpa or Hes1 promoter sequences. pGL3 promoter empty vector or the vector containing Pu.1, Cebpa or Hes1 promoter sequences, HA-HES1 expression plasmid or pcDNA3.1 control plasmid and Renillia expression vector were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using regular Calcium Phosphate transfection protocol. Luciferase activities were examined 24 hours after transfection using the Dual Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following manufacturer's instructions, and normalized to Renillia activity.
Statistical analysis
The means of each data set were analyzed using the Student's t test, with a two-tailed distribution and assuming equal sample variance.
