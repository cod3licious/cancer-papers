Methods Summary
Plasmid CMV-Kozak-human Ang1, Angptls 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 with FLAG tags at C-termini were used for transfection. Angptl2-FLAG was purified using M2 resin. Purified GST-Angptl5 was purchased from Abnova. Bacterially-expressed FLAG-Angptl2 and Angptl2-FLAG were constructed in pET-26b(+) vector, and GST-Angptls-FLAG in pGEX vector, and expressed and purified from bacteria. MSCV-LILRB2-IRES-GFP or control retrovirus infected BAF3 cells, CMV-driven LILRAs, LILRBs, PirB, or LAIR1 transfected 293T cells, or human mononuclear cord blood cells were used in binding assays. See the Full Methods for detailed experimental methods for flow cytometry, co-IP, SPR, liquid-phase binding, culture, transplantation, CFU, and GSEA analyses. Mice were maintained at the UT Southwestern Medical Center animal facility. All animal experiments were performed with the approval of UT Southwestern Committee on Animal Care.

Plasmids and proteins
Plasmid CMV-Kozak-human Ang1, Angptls 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 with FLAG tags at C-termini were transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000, and the conditioned medium at 48 h was collected and different Angptl proteins were adjusted to the same level for flow cytometry based binding experiments. Angptl2-FLAG was purified using M2 resin. Purified GST-Angptl5 was purchased from Abnova. Bacterially-expressed Flag-Angptl2 and Angptl2-Flag were constructed in pET-26b(+) vector, and GST-Angptls-FLAG in pGEX vector, and expressed and purified from bacteria.

The specificity of LILRB2 mAb is confirmed by comparison of binding to all tested LILRA/Bs on transfected 293T cells. The specificities of other anti-LILRBs, anti-PirB, and anti-LAIR1 were confirmed by staining the respective cDNA overexpressed 293T cells.
Co-immunoprecipitation
For in vivo co-IP, 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding LILRB2-ECD-hFc, PirB-ECD-hFc, or Tie-2-ECD-hFc and FLAG-tagged Angptl2 or untagged Angptl5. Protein A beads were added to conditioned medium collected at 48 h after transfection, and proteins were detected by anti-FLAG or anti-Angptl5 by western blot. For in vitro co-IP, purified Angptl2-FLAG or GST-Angptl5 was incubated with purified LILRB2-ECD-hFc or Tie2-ECD-hFc in PBS with 0.1% BSA and 0.1% NP-40 for 2 h followed by immunoprecipitated with protein A beads and western blotting.
Liquid-phase binding Assay
Specific binding of radiolabeled GST-Angptl5 to BAF3 stably infected with MSCV-LILRB2-IRES-GFP (as LILRB2-BAF3 cells) was performed similarly as we performed before 30. Briefly, 6 x 106 LILRB2-BAF3 cells were incubated with 125I-GST-Angptl5 (0.1 - 100 nM) in 200 ul PBS/1% BSA for 3 h at 25 degC. Nonspecific binding on normal BAF3 cells was subtracted. In competition assay, 2.5 x 106 LILRB2-BAF3 or BAF3 cells were incubated with unlabeled GST-Angptl5 (0.1 - 100 nM) in 200 ul PBS/1% BSA for 1 h at 25 degC, followed by addition of 5 nM of 125I-GST-Angptl5 for 4 h incubation. After incubation, the cells were washed twice by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 1% BSA and then measured in scintillation counter.
Cell culture and infection
BaF3 cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 with 10% FBS and 10% Wehi conditioned cell medium. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS.
For mouse HSC culture, indicated numbers of BM Lin-Sca-1+Kit+CD34-Flk-2- cells or fetal liver Lin-Sca-1+Kit+ cells isolated from 8-10 week old C57BL/6 CD45.2 mice were plated in one well of a U-bottom 96-well plate (Corning) with 200 ul of the indicated medium essentially as we described previously 4,9. Cells were cultured at 37degC in 5% CO2 and indicated levels of O2. For the purpose of competitive transplantation, we pooled cells from 12 culture wells and mixed them with competitor/supportive cells before the indicated numbers of cells were transplanted into each mouse. For western blotting, 3-week old mouse spleen cells were cultured overnight in DME supplemented with 0.1% BSA, followed by treatment with indicated amount of Angptls. Human mononuclear cord blood cells were cultured in DME containing 10% FBS overnight followed by starvation in serum-free DME for 4 h before Angptl stimulation.
The infection of Lin- cells by MSCV-MLL-AF9-IRES-YFP and MSCV-AML1-ETO9a-IRES-GFP was performed following procedures described by the Armstrong and Cleary laboratories 22,23 and Zhang laboratory 34, respectively. Briefly, we incubated Lin- cells overnight in medium with 10% FBS, 20 ng/mL SCF, 20 ng/ml IL-3, and 10 ng/mL IL-6, followed by spin infection with retroviral supernatant in the presence of 4 ug/mL polybrene. Infected cells (300,000) were transplanted into lethally irradiated (1000 rad) C57BL/6 mice by retro-orbital injection.
For human cell culture, fresh and cryopreserved human cord blood cells were obtained from UT Southwestern Parkland Hospital through approved IRB protocol 042008-033. CD34+ cells were isolated by AutoMACS and cultured essentially as we described 1,32. CD133+ cells were purchased from AllCell Inc. Lentiviral infection by shRNAs for LILRB2 or Angptls was performed as recommended by Open Biosystems.
Flow cytometry and reconstitution analysis
Donor mouse bone marrow cells were isolated from 8-10 week old C57BL/6 CD45.2 mice. BM Lin-Sca-1+Kit+CD34-Flk-2- cells were isolated by staining with a biotinylated lineage cocktail (anti-CD3, anti-CD5, anti-B220, anti-Mac-1, anti-Gr-1, anti-Ter119, and anti-7-4; Stem Cell Technologies) followed by streptavidin-PE/Cy5.5, anti-Sca-1-FITC, anti-Kit-APC, anti-CD34-PE, and anti-Flk-2-PE. The indicated numbers of mouse CD45.2 donor cells were mixed with 1 x 105 freshly isolated CD45.1 competitor bone marrow cells, and the mixture injected intravenously via the retro-orbital route into each of a group of 6-9 week old CD45.1 mice previously irradiated with a total dose of 10 Gy. To measure reconstitution of transplanted mice, peripheral blood was collected at the indicated times post-transplant and CD45.1+ and CD45.2+ cells in lymphoid and myeloid compartments were measured as we described 4,9,32. The analyses of Mac-1, Kit, Gr-1, CD3, B220 populations in AML blood or bone marrow were performed by using anti-Mac-1-APC, anti-Kit-PE, anti-Gr-1-PE, anti-CD3-APC, and anti-B220-PE.
Uncultured or cultured progenies of human cells were pooled together and the indicated portions were injected intravenously via the retro-orbital route into sub-lethally irradiated (250 rad) 6-8 week old NOD/SCID mice. Eight weeks after transplantation, bone marrow nucleated cells from transplanted animals were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of human cells as we described 1,32.
CFU assays
Two thousand YFP+Mac-1+Kit+ BM cells from AML mice were plated in methylcellulose (M3534, Stem Cell Technologies) for CFU-GM assays, according to the manufacturer's protocols and our previously published protocol 35. After 7 days, 2000 cells from initially plated three dishes were used for secondary replating.
Surface plasmon resonance
Biacore 2000 and CM5 chips were used to analyze binding of purified Angptls to the LILRB2 extracellular domain fused to hFc, using a method similar to that previously described 36. Recombinant protein A (Pierce) was pre-immobilized in two flow cells (~2,000 RU) using the amine-coupling kit from GE. LILRB2-hFc was injected into one of the flow cells to be captured by the protein A to reach ~300 response units (RU). GST-Angptl5 was injected over the immobilized LILRB2 in HBS-EP (GE) containing 0.01 M HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20. Each binding sensorgram from the sample flow cell, containing a captured LILRB2-hFc, was corrected for the protein A coupled cell control. Following each injection of an antigen solution, which induced the binding reaction, and the dissociation period during which the running buffer was infused, the protein A surface was regenerated by the injection of the regeneration solution containing 10 mM Na3PO4 (pH 2.5) and 500 mM NaCl. All captured LILRB2-hFc, with and without Angptl5 bound, was completely removed, and another cycle begun. All measurements were performed at 25degC with a flow rate of 30 uL/min.
GSEA analysis
Gene set enrichment analysis 37 was performed using GSEA v2.0 software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) with 1,000 phenotype permutations, and normalized enrichment score (NES) and false discovery rate q-value (FDR q-val) were calculated. Leukemia-stem-cell and macrophage development gene sets were obtained from the indicated publication 23,38.
Statistics
Two-tailed student t-test was performed to evaluate significance between experimental groups, unless otherwise is indicated. The survival rates of the two groups will be analyzed using a log-rank test.
