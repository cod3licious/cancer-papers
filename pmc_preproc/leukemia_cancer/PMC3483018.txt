Optimization of Imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-Based Kinase Inhibitors: Identification of a
Dual FLT3/Aurora
Kinase Inhibitor as an Orally Bioavailable Preclinical Development
Candidate for the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Optimization of the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-based series of Aurora kinase inhibitors led to the identification of 6-chloro-7-(4-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (27e), a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases (Aurora-A Kd = 7.5 nM, Aurora-B Kd = 48 nM), FLT3 kinase (Kd = 6.2 nM), and FLT3 mutants including FLT3-ITD (Kd = 38 nM) and FLT3(D835Y) (Kd = 14 nM). FLT3-ITD causes constitutive FLT3 kinase activation and is detected in 20-35% of adults and 15% of children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), conferring a poor prognosis in both age groups. In an in vivo setting, 27e strongly inhibited the growth of a FLT3-ITD-positive AML human tumor xenograft (MV4-11) following oral administration, with in vivo biomarker modulation and plasma free drug exposures consistent with dual FLT3 and Aurora kinase inhibition. Compound 27e, an orally bioavailable dual FLT3 and Aurora kinase inhibitor, was selected as a preclinical development candidate for the treatment of human malignancies, in particular AML, in adults and children.

Introduction
Aurora kinases, a family of three serine-threonine
kinases designated
A, B, and C, play key and distinct roles in different stages of mitosis.1-3 At the early stages of mitosis, Aurora-A forms a complex with TPX2
(targeting protein for Xklp2) that regulates centrosome maturation
and mitotic spindle assembly.4,5 Aurora-B forms complexes
with the inner centromere protein (INCENP), survivin and borealin,
thereby regulating chromosome condensation, chromosome alignment,
mitotic checkpoint, and cytokinesis.6-9 Overexpression of Aurora-A and -B has been
reported in a wide range of human malignancies, including breast,
colorectal, ovarian, glioma, thyroid carcinoma, and seminoma.10-16 The function of Aurora-C during mitosis is less well understood.
However, high expression of Aurora-C has been reported in the testis.17,18

of Aurora kinases.
In recent years, small-molecule targeting of the
Aurora kinases
has become a common strategy for the discovery of new molecularly
targeted cancer therapeutics for the treatment of solid tumors and
hematological malignancies, including AML.19,20 Some inhibitors of Aurora kinases were reported to inhibit FLT3,18 and high expression of Aurora kinases has been
demonstrated in leukemia cell lines and patient cohorts.21-24 A number of structurally diverse inhibitors of Aurora kinase activity
have been reported,18,25,26 including 1 [VX-680 (MK-0457)],272 (AZD1152),283 (PHA-739358),29,30 and 4 (AMG
900)31 (Figure 1).

kinases.
We have previously reported the discovery of 6 (Figure 2), a novel, potent, and
orally bioavailable inhibitor
of Aurora kinases that inhibits growth of the SW620 human colon carcinoma
xenograft with concomitant biomarker modulation consistent with target
engagement.32 However, the preclinical
development of this compound was limited by a narrow safety margin
against hERG (IC50 = 3.0 mM)32 and low human liver microsomal stability (86% metabolized after
a 30 min incubation, unpublished data). Herein, we report the evolution
of the medicinal chemistry program to identify orally bioavailable
dual FLT3/Aurora kinase inhibitors with higher metabolic stability
and wider therapeutic index against hERG suitable for preclinical
evaluation.

Chemistry

hydrolysis34 in a manner similar to that
described for synthesis of 9c and 9d (Scheme 3). Compounds 21a-i and 22a-e respectively presented

readily accessed by reaction of 7 or 8 with
the requisite commercially available aldehyde in the presence of Na2S2O4.32,33
The
synthesis of 1,3-dimethylpyrazole derivatives 27a-g (Table 5) is shown

by nucleophilic displacement of the C-4 chloride of 12 with the appropriate piperazine derivative. Boc-piperazines 24f and 24g were prepared by a reductive alkylation
of 1-Boc-piperazine (23) with 5-formylpyrimidine and
pyrazine-2-carbaldehyde, respectively. The Boc-piperazine derivatives 24b and 24d were obtained by a substitution reaction
of 1-Boc-piperazine (23) with 3-(chloromethyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazole
and 3-(chloromethyl)-1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole,
respectively (Scheme 4).

Results and Discussion
Compound 6 and
its 6-Cl counterpart 5 (Figure 2) served as starting points for
our investigation aimed at identifying orally bioavailable inhibitors
of Aurora kinases suitable for preclinical evaluation. The crystal
structure of 6 bound to Aurora-A32 and the existing structure-activity relationship in this
series32,35 provided us with a clear understanding of
the interactions of this class of compounds with Aurora kinases. The
N4 pyridine hydrogen bond acceptor and the N3 imidazole hydrogen bond
donor of the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine scaffold form
hydrogen bonds to Ala213 in the hinge region of the kinase.32 The R2 (4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl
substituent points into the solvent accessible area with the lipophilic
phenyl ring residing in close proximity to Gly216. The R3 5-methylisoxazol-3-yl group makes contact with the Gly-rich loop,
and in vitro compound profiling and subsequent Free-Wilson
analysis36 identified p-chlorophenyl, and 5-methylisoxazol-3-yl as the R3 substituents
most frequently observed in highly active compounds. The incorporation
of a Br or Cl substituent at the C6 position results in a significant
increase in enzyme inhibitory activity with 6-Br/Cl derivatives >8-fold
more potent relative to their unsubstituted counterparts.32,35 Selected physicochemical properties for this class of compounds
were also studied. The measured log D7.4 for compound 6 is 2.58,37 and for the analogue of 6 where R2 = p-methoxyphenyl (i.e., 6-bromo-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-[4-(5-methyl-isoxazol-3-ylmethyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine),32 the pKa of the piperazine nitrogen
bearing the 5-methylisoxazol-3-yl substituent was measured as 5.39
and the acidic pKa of the imidazopyridine
N3 proton was 9.51, consistent with a strong hydrogen bond donor.37 The pKa of the N-Me piperazine nitrogen in 6 was calculated
as 8.50.38,39
In pharmacophore models for hERG blockade,
it is reported that
a basic nitrogen in lipophilic molecules can increase hERG inhibitory
potency via p-cation stacking.40-42 As a consequence, one
of the most common strategies for designing out hERG affinity involves
the reduction of the pKa and/or the introduction
of steric bulk or shielding around the basic nitrogen.41 The concomitant reduction of both pKa and clogP often leads to a reduction in hERG activity.41 It has been suggested that a 1 log unit reduction
in clogP leads to 0.8 log unit reduction in hERG activity.41 In a recent study by Waring and Johnstone, the
relationship between hERG and log P for acids, bases,
neutrals, and zwitterions was investigated.43 In that study, it was reported that a higher log P is associated with an increasing potential for hERG affinity, with
basic compounds being more likely to have hERG liabilities than neutrals.43 With this in mind, our approaches to lower hERG
affinity involved modulation of the pKa of the N-Me piperazine nitrogen, introduction of
steric bulk around this nitrogen, and replacement of the R2 (4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl substituent with a weakly basic or
neutral five-membered heteroaromatic moiety. The latter approach could
potentially lead to a neutral molecule of lower molecular mass and
clogP with the potential to reduce both hERG affinity and susceptibility
to oxidative metabolism.44,45
Replacement of
the N-methylpiperazine moiety in 6 with
a morpholine ring (compound 10a) was beneficial
in reducing affinity for hERG, consistent with our hypothesis that
hERG affinity is driven by the presence of a piperazine basic center.
However, this change was detrimental to human liver microsomal stability
(99% of parent compound was metabolized following 30 min incubation,
Table 1). Tactics
to introduce steric bulk and lower the pKa of the piperazine nitrogen by acetylation (nonbasic, compound 10b) or introduction of a pendant methoxyethyl side chain
(compound 10d, calculated pKa = 8.0638,39) did not lower hERG affinity. The introduction
of steric bulk around the N-methylpiperazine nitrogen
(compounds 10c and 10e, Table 1) resulted in retention of the Aurora-A, and tumor cell growth
inhibitory activity but failed to reduce hERG inhibitory potency.
Analogues 10c,e displayed affinities for hERG similar
to those observed with the parent compounds 5 and 6 (Table 1). In addition, the high
susceptibility to human liver metabolism remained a concern, with
HLM stability values for compounds 10b-e similar to those for the parent compounds 5 and 6 (Table 1).
In a further attempt to lower the pKa of the N-Me piperazine nitrogen in 5, a fluoro substituent was introduced on the phenyl ring
ortho or
meta to the piperazine (Table 2, compounds 20a, 20b, respectively).
The o-F substituted analogue 20a (piperazine N-Me nitrogen calculated pKa = 7.9838,39) was less potent in inhibiting hERG compared
to 5; however, its human liver microsomal stability remained
low (68% metabolized after a 30 min incubation). The m-F substituted derivative 20b (piperazine N-Me nitrogen calculated pKa = 8.5038,39) displayed a similar affinity for hERG compared to the parent compound 5. The m-F substituted analogue 20b was a less potent inhibitor of Aurora-A compared to its o-regioisomer 20a, a trend consistent with
previously reported SAR in this series.35
The positional effect of the basic nitrogen on human
microsomal
stability and hERG affinity was next investigated (Table 2, compounds 20c-f). The m-CH2NMe2 and m-OCH2CH2NMe2 analogues (compounds 20d, 20c, respectively) displayed similar hERG inhibitory
activities to 5 (Tables 1 and 2). The moderately basic morpholino derivative 20e exhibited low affinity for hERG, but was rapidly metabolized
in mouse and human liver microsomes. However, the introduction of
the N-methyl piperazine moiety at the m-position (compound 20f, Table 2) resulted in a desirable outcome in relation to both hERG inhibitory
activity and MLM/HLM metabolic stability. Compound 20f inhibited hERG with an IC50 value of 9.50 mM (Table 2; see also general experimental) and displayed high
human liver microsomal stability (24% metabolized after a 30 min incubation
versus 89% for compound 5 and 86% for compound 6).
Subsequently, our chemical efforts were focused
on the introduction
of neutral or weakly basic R2 heteroaryl substituents.
To this end, the Aurora-A and tumor cell growth inhibitory effect
of replacing the R2 (4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl moiety
in 5 and 6 with a range of five-membered
heteroaromatic rings was studied (Table 3). With the exception of 1-methyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl and 1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl derivatives 21a and 21i, all analogues presented in Table 3 were considerably less potent inhibitors of Aurora-A
compared to 5 or 6 (Table 1). In particular, the incorporation of a 1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl, 2,5-dimethyloxazol-4-yl, 5-methylisoxazol-3-yl,
and 1,2,3-thiadiazol-4-yl as an R2 substituent (compounds 21b, 21d, 21e, 21f,
respectively) resulted in a significant drop in Aurora-A inhibitory
potency. To unequivocally establish the binding mode of these 2-heteroaryl-based
analogues to Aurora-A, compound 21a was cocrystallized
with the catalytic domain of Aurora-A (residues 122-403). The
crystal structure of 21a bound to Aurora-A was determined
to a resolution of 2.5 A (Figure 3, Table
S1, Supporting Information), and shows
that 21a occupies the ATP-binding site in a mode similar
to that described for 6.32 As was observed for 6, the isoxazole group of 21a interacts with the Gly-rich loop of Aurora-A between residues
141 and 146; in addition, the side chain of Lys143 makes an additional
contact, although the significance of this is unclear. As expected,
the R2 imidazole ring of 21a sits close to
Gly216, in an equivalent position to the phenyl ring of 6, with the methyl substituent pointing away from the hinge to avoid
steric clashes with the main chain Ala213 and Pro214. The Aurora-A
affinity observed for compounds 21a (IC50 =
0.015 mM), 21c (IC50 = 0.068 mM),
and 21i (IC50 = 0.045 mM) is consistent
with a preferred, sterically restricted, lipophilic interaction with
Ala213, which is satisfied by the C4-H of the imidazole ring
of 21a (Figure 3) but is precluded
in 21d (IC50 = 2.2 mM) owing to the
presence of either a polar nitrogen atom or more sterically demanding
methyl moiety in the same vector.

red; bromine, brown; carbon in Aurora-A, white; carbon in 21a, green. The final 2mFo-DFc electron density map surrounding 21a is shown as a gray wire-mesh, contoured at 1.0 s.
The two most promising compounds (i.e., 21a and 21i, Table 3) were subject
to additional
in vitro profiling which revealed the 1-methyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl derivative 21a to be an inhibitor of
hERG (94% inhibition at 10 mM). The 1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl analogue 21i was also an inhibitor of
hERG (67% at 10 mM), but exhibited high stability in both MLM
(20% metabolized after a 30 min incubation) and HLM (10% metabolized
after a 30 min incubation). The tPSA and the clogP for 21i were calculated as 80.42 and 2.37, respectively.46 On the basis of these findings, 21i was selected
as a scaffold for an optimization study aimed at increasing the Aurora-A/tumor
cell growth inhibitory potencies and reducing hERG affinity.
Replacement of the N1-methyl in the R2 pyrazole subsituent of 21i with an ethyl, isopropyl,
or difluoroethyl substituent (compounds 22a, 22b, 22c, respectively, Table 4) gave no Aurora-A or tumor cell growth inhibitory
benefit, although high stability to human liver microsomal metabolism
was maintained (Table 4). On the other hand,
the introduction of an additional methyl group at the 3-position of
the pyrazole ring in 21i (compound 22d,
Table 4) resulted in an enhancement to Aurora-A
inhibition and SW620 cell growth inhibitory potency. In addition,
the inhibitory activity of 22d against hERG was determined
as 48% at 10 mM (IC50 = 6.3 mM, Table 4). Subsequent introduction of a C3-cyclopropyl group,
a bulkier and more lipophilic substituent, led to a marginal increase
in Aurora-A inhibitory potency (22e vs 22d, Table 4). However, compound 22e inhibited hERG with an IC50 value of 2.5 mM (Table 4). On balance, the data presented in Table 4 point to 1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl
as an optimal R2 substituent.
Having identified 1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl
as a preferred R2 substituent, our efforts focused on exploring
the R3 substituent. Our aim was to further improve the
in vitro profile, in particular to reduce hERG affinity, and to subsequently
progress the most promising analogues to in vivo PK characterization
and evaluation in a human tumor xenograft model. The R3 5-methylisoxazol-3-yl group in 22d (Table 4) was replaced with a range of five- and six-membered aromatic
heterocycles and the p-chlorophenyl previously identified
by Free-Wilson analysis as a preferred substituent (Table 5). The 4-methyl-1,2,5-oxadiazole
derivative 27a was a more potent inhibitor of Aurora-A
and SW620 tumor cell growth relative to 22d but highly
susceptible to metabolism, in particular in mouse liver microsomes.
On the other hand, the 1,2,4-oxadiazole analogues 27b and 27c exhibited lower Aurora-A and SW620 tumor cell
inhibitory potency relative to 22d. Both 27b and 27c displayed similar inhibitory activities against
hERG (IC50 values of 11.0 and 9.5 mM, respectively;
Table 5). The 1,2,4-triazole analogue 27d displayed considerably lower Aurora-A and SW620 tumor
cell inhibitory potencies relative to 22d, though its
affinity for hERG was significantly reduced (14% inhibition at 10
mM). The introduction of the R3p-chlorophenyl substituent was, however, beneficial versus inhibition
of SW620 tumor cell growth (compound 27e (CCT241736),
GI50 = 0.283 mM). In addition, 27e inhibited
Aurora-A with an IC50 value 0.038 mM, was highly
stable in mouse and human microsomes (34% and 10% metabolized after
a 30 min incubation respectively), and displayed low affinity for
hERG (IC50 > 25 mM). Finally, two more polar six-membered
heteroaromatic substituents were explored, i.e., pyrimid-5-yl and
pyrazin-2-yl (27f and 27g, respectively);
both derivatives exhibited low affinity for hERG (32% and 23% inhibition
at 10 mM respectively) but also low stability in both mouse
and human liver microsomes. Although a trend to lower hERG inhibition
was observed with less lipophilic compounds (compare compounds 22b,c in Table 4 with compounds 27d,f,g in Table 5), structural modifications
that increase log P could also interestingly reduce
affinity for hERG, as illustrated for compound 27e (clogP
= 4.81,47 hERG IC50 > 25
mM)
compared to 22d (clogP = 2.34, hERG IC50 =
6.3 mM). Considering the impact of these R3 modifications
(Table 5) on MLM stability, all four R3 five-membered heteroaromatic-substituted compounds, 27a (clogP = 2.34), 27b (clogP = 1.45), 27c (clogP = 1.72), and 27d (clogP = 1.21), were
more susceptible to mouse liver metabolism compared with 22d despite displaying lower or equal clogP (22d, clogP
= 2.34). A similar trend was observed with the R3 six-membered
heteroaromatic compounds 27f (clogP = 1.64) and 27g (clogP = 1.64), both being significantly more susceptible
to mouse liver metabolism compared with p-chlorophenyl
derivative 27e. On the basis of a desirable set of in
vitro properties, compound 27e was selected for in depth
in vitro and in vivo characterization. Kinase selectivity was assessed
by profiling 27e in a 442-kinase panel (containing 386
nonmutant kinases) at a concentration of 1 mM using the KINOMEScan
technology (see Table S2, Supporting Information).48-50 The S(10) selectivity score, which is calculated
by dividing the number of nonmutant kinases for which >90% competition
of control ligand is observed (this is measured as <10% of control)
by the total number of nonmutant kinases tested, was determined as
0.057, i.e., 22 hits from the 386 nonmutant kinases tested. As expected,
Aurora-A, -B, and -C were potently inhibited with percent control
values of 3.4, 1, and 16, respectively, at 1 mM. Consistent
with previous data on this imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
series,51 screening also revealed greater
than 94% competition for wild-type FLT3 kinase and clinically relevant
FLT3-resistant mutants including FLT3-ITD and FLT3(D835Y) which was
confirmed by Kd determination (Table 6). Taken together, these data indicate that 27e is a potent dual inhibitor of FLT3 and Aurora kinases
with few off-target kinase activities across the kinome (Figure 4).
Figure 4
TREEspot interaction map48 depicting the selectivity profile for 27e. Significant
off-target inhibition was observed for FLT1, JAK2, RET, and PDGFRB
with percent control values of 0.3, 1.3, 1.8, and 4 at 1 mM
respectively (Supporting Information, Table
S2).
Selected examples from the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
series including compound 6, which we recently reported
as a dual FLT3/Aurora inhibitor,51 were
also tested against FLT3 and FLT3-ITD. All compounds tested displayed
potent affinity for both forms of FLT3 kinase (Table 7), indicating that FLT3 binding is a common feature for this
series of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines. FLT3 is a trans-membrane
kinase of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. Binding
of FLT3-ligand (FL) to its receptor leads to dimerization, autophosphorylation,
and subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways, playing
a role in the survival and proliferation of leukemic cells.52 High levels of FLT3 expression have been found
in AML blasts, and two major classes of activating mutations, i.e.
internal-tandem duplications (ITDs) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD)
point mutations, have been identified in AML patients.52,53 ITDs are detected in 20-25% of AML patients, and TKD point
mutations in 5-10% of AML patients.52,53 Internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) results in constitutive FLT3 kinase activation.54 Meshinchi et al. reported that FLT3-ITD is detected in 20-35% of adults and 15% of children with
AML, conferring a poor prognosis in both age groups.55 Over the past decade FLT3 inhibition has emerged as a therapeutic
strategy of interest for the treatment of AML, and a number of small-molecule
inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials.53,56
Consistent with dual FLT3/Aurora inhibitory activity,
compound 27e displayed antiproliferative activity in
a range of human
tumor cell lines, including HCT116 human colon carcinoma (GI50 = 0.300 mM) and the human FLT3-ITD positive
AML cell lines MOLM-13 (GI50 = 0.104 mM) and MV4-11
(GI50 = 0.291 mM). In Hela cervical cancer cells, 27e inhibited both the autophosphorylation of Aurora-A at
T288 (a biomarker for Aurora-A inhibition: IC50 = 0.030
mM) and histone H3 phosphorylation at S10 (a biomarker for Aurora-B
inhibition: IC50 = 0.148 mM),57,58 consistent with potent cellular activity versus both Aurora-A and
-B. Compound 27e also inhibited Aurora-A in MOLM-13 cells
with concomitant inhibition of FLT3 signaling (FLT3 phosphorylation,
data not shown).
The inhibition of cytochrome P450 isoforms
by 27e was
also investigated. Compound 27e did not significantly
inhibit the major cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4); all IC50 values were greater
than 10 mM. Compound 27e performed well in the
Caco-2 assay, giving a permeability of 18.6 x 10-6 cm/s with no efflux. The desirable set of in vitro properties led
to the in vivo evaluation of 27e. The mouse plasma protein
binding for 27e was determined as 97.3%, and the PK profile
of 27e in mouse revealed a highly orally bioavailable
compound (F = 100%) with moderate clearance (0.058
L/h, 48 mL/min/kg) and Vd (0.066 L, 3.3 L/kg) (Table 8). Pharmacokinetic evaluation in rats also showed high oral
bioavailability (79%), low clearance (0.057 L/h, 4.57 mL/min/kg),
and moderate volume of distribution (0.369 L, 1.79 L/kg) (Table 8).
Figure 5
Oral efficacy of 27e against MV4-11 human FLT3-ITD positive AML tumor xenografts in athymic mice (dosing
interval day 0-11; twice daily for 7 days, and once daily for
a further 4 days): (A) relative tumor volumes +- SEM and (B) mouse
body weights. N = 5 per group.
The encouraging in vivo pharmacokinetic profile
coupled with dual
FLT3/Aurora inhibitory activity prompted us to evaluate 27e in a human AML subcutaneous xenograft model. As shown in Figure 5, 27e strongly inhibited the growth
of MV4-11 human tumor xenografts in a dose-dependent manner
with no observed toxicity as defined by body weight loss and general
condition. When therapy was discontinued after 11 days, tumors were
undetectable in mice treated with an oral dose of 100 mg/kg po b.i.d. 27e and had decreased to 42% of the initial volume in those
treated with 50 mg/kg b.i.d. Control mice were culled on day 18 from
the start of therapy when the mean tumor volume had increased by over
500%. In contrast, individual mice were culled when tumors progressed
to this stage as follows: days 28 and 31 at 50 mg/kg and days 46 and
56 at 100 mg/kg. Three out of five mice in each treatment group (60%)
did not develop progressively growing tumors at the time the study
was terminated on day 60, indicative of long-term growth control.
As a result of this potent in vivo antitumor effect, tumors from treated
animals were too small to provide material for a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic

PK/PD study in mice bearing MV4-11 human FLT3-ITD-positive
AML tumor xenografts treated with 27e (50 and 100 mg/kg
po, b.i.d., for 4 days). (A) Total plasma and tumor concentrations
and free plasma concentrations; all samples were taken 2 h after the
final dose. (B) Inhibition of histone H-3 phosphorylation at S10 and
inhibition of Stat5 phosphorylation at Y694. Tumor samples were obtained
2 h after the final dose. Total histone H3, total Stat5, and GAPDH
were used as loading controls.
A 4-day PK/PD study (27e po at 50
and 100 mg/kg b.i.d.)
showed clear inhibition of both histone H-3 phosphorylation and Stat5
phosphorylation (a direct downstream target of FLT3 kinase) at 2 h
after the final dose, consistent with dual inhibition of Aurora and
FLT3 kinases in the tumor (Figure 6).51,59,60 In addition, average free drug
concentrations in plasma samples obtained 2 h after the final dose
(222 and 488 nM for the 50 and 100 mg/kg dosing schedules, respectively;
Figure 6) significantly exceed Kd values of 27e against the relevant kinases,
i.e., Aurora-A (Kd = 7.5 nM), Aurora-B
(Kd = 48 nM), FLT3 (Kd = 6.2 nM), FLT3-ITD (Kd = 38 nM). These findings demonstrate that 27e significantly inhibits the growth of a clinically relevant FLT3-ITD-positive AML human tumor xenograft model in vivo,
with biomarker modulation and free drug exposure consistent with dual
FLT3 and Aurora kinase target inhibition.

Conclusion
Compound 6 and its 6-Cl counterpart 5 were used as starting points for medicinal chemistry optimization
aimed at the identification of an orally bioavailable preclinical
development candidate. In the course of this work we paid particular
attention to minimization of hERG inhibition and human liver microsomal
instability. We found that the switch of the N-methylpiperazine
moiety in compound 5 to the m-position
was beneficial in reducing affinity for hERG and significantly increasing
the human liver microsomal stability. Replacement of the R2 (4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl substituent with five-membered heteroaromatics
led to the identification of 1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl
as an optimal R2 substituent. Subsequent property refinement
by R3 substituent modification led to 27e,
an orally bioavailable, dual FLT3/Aurora kinase inhibitor with high
selectivity within the tested kinome. Compound 27e also
potently inhibits mutant FLT3 kinases, including FLT3-ITD, which causes
constitutive FLT3 kinase activation and is detected in 20-35%
of adults and 15% of children with AML, conferring a poor prognosis
in both age groups. In an in vivo setting, 27e strongly
inhibited the growth of a FLT3-ITD-positive AML human
tumor xenograft with biomarker modulation and plasma free drug exposures
consistent with dual FLT3 and Aurora kinase target inhibition. Compound 27e, an orally bioavailable dual FLT3/Aurora kinase inhibitor,
has been selected as a preclinical development candidate for the treatment
of human malignancies, with particular relevance for the treatment
of AML in adults and children who become resistant to existing therapies.61

with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated to
leave a cream solid. This was triturated with ether (2 mL) and the
solid further washed with ether (1 mL) to leave the product (58 mg,
67%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): 2.41 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.52 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.63

5-Chloro-4-(4-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-nitropyridin-2-amine
(26e)
To a mixture of 2-amino-4,5-dichloro-3-nitropyridine
(0.152 g, 0.73 mmol) and 2-propanol (22 mL) was added 1-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperazine
(0.165 g, 0.78 mmol) followed by diisopropylethylamine (0.17 mL, 0.97
mmol). The reaction mixture was heated at 45 degC for 18 h, allowed
to cool to room temperature, and diluted with 2-propanol (5 mL). The
precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with 2-propanol, and
diethyl ether. The title compound was thus obtained as a yellow solid
(0.215 g, 77%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): 2.48 (br s, obscured by DMSO peak, 4H, piperazine
C-H), 3.06 (br t, J = 4.3 Hz, 4H, piperazine
C-H), 3.52 (s, 2H, NCH2C6H4Cl), 6.95 (s, 2H, NH2),
7.35 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H) and 7.38 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H) (3,5-ArH and 2,6-ArH), 8.06 (s, 1H, 6-H). LC-MS
(ESI, m/z): tR = 1.70 min; 382, 384, 386 (M + H)+, Cl2 isotopic pattern.
6-Chloro-7-(4-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (27e)
To a mixture of 5-chloro-4-(4-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-nitropyridin-2-amine
(0.076 g, 0.20 mmol) and EtOH (4.0 mL) was added 1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde (0.027 g, 0.22 mmol) followed
by a freshly prepared aqueous solution of Na2S2O4 (1 M, 0.85 mL, 0.85 mmol). The reaction mixture was
stirred at 80 degC for 24 h, allowed to cool to room temperature,
and concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was absorbed on silica
gel and placed on a 10 g ISOLUTE silica column. Elution with ethyl
acetate/dichloromethane (v/v, 1:1) and then 4% methanol in ethyl acetate/dichloromethane
(v/v; 1:1) afforded the title compound as a white solid after trituration
with diethyl ether (0.023 g, 25%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): 2.51 (s, obscured by solvent peak, pyrazole
3-CH3), 2.57 (br s, 4H, piperazine C-H), 3.54 (s,
2H, N-CH2C6H4Cl), 3.68 (br s, 4H, piperazine C-H), 3.84 (s,
3H, pyrazole N-Me), 7.37 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H) and
7.40 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H) (C6H4Cl), 8.02 (s, 1H), and 8.18 (s, 1H) (pyrazole 5-H, and imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine 5-H), 12.95 (br s, 1H, imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine N-H). LC-MS (ESI, m/z): tR = 1.97 min; 456, 458,
460 (M + H)+, Cl2 isotopic pattern. HRMS: found
456.1457, calcd for C22H24Cl2N7 (M + H)+ 456.1465.
