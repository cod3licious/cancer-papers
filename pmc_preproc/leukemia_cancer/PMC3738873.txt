PKC? Regulates T-Cell Leukemia-Initiating Activity via Reactive Oxygen Species. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a by-product of cellular metabolism, damage intracellular macromolecules and, in excess, can promote normal hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and exhaustion1-3. However, mechanisms that regulate ROS levels in leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and the biological role of ROS in these cells remain largely unknown. We show here the ROSlow subset of CD44+ cells in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignancy of immature T-cell progenitors, to be highly enriched in the most aggressive LICs, and that ROS are maintained at low levels by downregulation of protein kinase C theta (PKCth). Strikingly, primary mouse T-ALLs lacking PKCth show improved LIC activity whereas enforced PKCth expression in both mouse and human primary T-ALLs compromised LIC activity. We also demonstrate that PKCth is positively regulated by RUNX1, and that NOTCH1, which is frequently activated by mutation in T-ALL4-6 and required for LIC activity in both mouse and human models7,8, downregulates PKCth and ROS via a novel pathway involving induction of RUNX3 and subsequent repression of RUNX1. These results reveal key functional roles for PKCth and ROS in T-ALL and suggest that aggressive biological behavior in vivo could be limited by therapeutic strategies that promote PKCth expression/activity or ROS accumulation.

Mice
PKCth (Prkcq) knock-out mice (backcrossed over 10 generations to C57BL/6) have been described previously24. We obtained C57BL/6 (Ly5.2), B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyJ (Ly5.1), and NOD/Scid/Il2rg-/- (NSG) mice from in-house colonies maintained at the BC Cancer Agency (BCCA) Animal Resource Centre. We housed all animals in specific pathogen-free facilities according to institutional guidelines. All breeding and animal experiments were performed under protocols approved by the University of British Columbia (UBC) Animal Care Committee and according to guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Viruses
We produced high titer, replication-defective retroviral supernatants by transient transfection of PlatE cells41, and lentivirus by transient co-transfection of 293T cells with packaging/envelope vectors as described42. MSCV-based retroviral expression vectors encoding constitutively active NOTCH1 (DE or L1601P-DPEST alleles) with IRES-GFP or IRES-tNGFR cassettes for tagging of transduced cells have been described19,21,39. We constructed similar retroviral expression vectors carrying a wild-type PKCth cDNA. The dominant negative Mastermind-like-1 (DN-MAML) retroviral construct encoding amino acids 13-74 of human MAML1 fused to GFP has been previously described39. We expressed RUNX3 and constitutively activated PKCth (A148E mutation)26 cDNAs from the lentiviral vector pRRL-cPPT/CTS-MNDU3-PGK-GFP-WPRE which is composed of the pRRLsin-18 backbone43,44, cPPT with central DNA flap45,46, MNDU3 promoter47,48, PGK-GFP marker, and WPRE element (plasmid construction details available upon request). We cloned the RNAi Consortium (TRC) shRNAs49 targeting PKCth (shPKCth-91, TRCN0000001791; shPKCth-92, TRCN0000001792), RUNX1 (shRUNX1-58, TRCN0000013658; shRUNX1-59, TRCN0000013659), and RUNX3 (shRUNX3, TRCN0000235674) into pLKO.1puro lentivector as described50. We obtained the scrambled shRNA control (shScramble) in pLKO.1puro vector from Addgene (#1864)51. We verified all constructs by sequencing. We isolated virally transduced cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) or by selection with puromycin as applicable.
Bone Marrow Transplantation
To generate primary mouse leukemias, we transduced bone marrow cells from 5-fluorouracil treated mice (C57BL/6 background) with retrovirus by spinoculation20. Three days later, we injected 10,000-40,000 GFP+ or NGFR+ cells (including at least 1x105 normal bone marrow cells) into the tail vein of lethally irradiated (810 rad) C57BL/6 recipients. For serial transplantation experiments, we injected varying numbers of total or FACS-sorted primary leukemia cells by tail vein into non-irradiated C57BL/6 or sublethally irradiated (200 rad) NSG secondary recipient mice. We monitored all transplant recipient mice daily for clinical signs of leukemia. We also followed leukemia engraftment and progression in some recipients by periodic peripheral blood sampling and flow cytometric analysis.
Human Samples
We obtained all human samples with appropriate institutional approvals (UBC/BCCA Research Ethics Board, Institutional Review Board of the Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie/Universite Paris Diderot, Karmanos Cancer Center Institutional Review Board, and MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board) and informed consent under guidelines established by the Declaration of Helsinki. We isolated mononuclear cells from fresh bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood samples by density gradient centrifugation and used them directly or cryopreserved them. Subsequent analyses utilized human-specific antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD4, and/or CD8 (eBioscience) to discern human T-ALL blasts.
Cell Culture
All established cell lines have been reported previously6,34,52. We cultured these cell lines in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. We isolated primary mouse leukemia cells from the bone marrow or spleen of moribund mice and, where indicated, cultured them briefly in vitro in complete media as above with supplemental cytokines IL-2 and IL-7, each at 10 ng ml-1 (Peprotech). We expanded primary human T-ALL lymphoblasts as xenografts in sublethally irradiated in NSG mice and, where indicated, cultured them briefly in vitro on MS5/MS5-DL1 feeders7 or immobilized Ig-DL1 ligand53 as described20.
To inhibit PKCth enzymatic activity, we treated cells in vitro with 5 uM myristoylated PKCth pseudosubstrate inhibitor (cat #539636, Calbiochem). To inhibit Notch signaling, we treated cells in vitro with 1 uM g-secretase inhibitor XXI (compound E; cat #ALX-270-415, Alexis). To reduce ROS levels directly, we treated cells in vitro with the vitamin E-derivative antioxidant, Trolox (Calbiochem) at 50 uM final concentration.
We achieved doxycycline-inducible expression of DN-MAML39 by lentiviral transduction of cells with pLVX-Tet-On Advanced (Clontech, CMV-IE promoter replaced with EF1a promoter) followed by selection in G418, then with DN-MAML in pLVX-Tight-Puro (Clontech) followed by selection in puromycin.
Chemotherapy and Radiation Resistance Assays
To assess drug sensitivity in vitro, we treated cells with doxorubicin (5 ug ml-1 for primary mouse leukemias, 2 ug ml-1 for human cell lines) or dexamethasone (10 ug ml-1 for primary mouse leukemias, 100 ug ml-1 for human cell lines) and assayed 48-72 hours later. To assess radiation sensitivity in vitro, we treated cells with X-irradiation using a single 10 Gy dose and assayed 48-72 hours later. We measured cell viability by flow cytometry for exclusion of propidium iodide. To assess DNA damage in vitro, we treated cells with X-irradiation using a single 1 Gy dose, cultured them for 1 hour, and then analyzed them for phospho-histone H2A.X by flow cytometry.
Flow Cytometry
We stained mouse and human leukemia cells with fluorochrome or biotin-conjugated antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD44 (eBioscience, Biolegend). We used anti-hCD271 (1:50 dilution; cat #130-091, Miltenyi Biotec) to detect the retroviral NGFR marker. We performed intracellular staining with antibodies against PKCth (1:5 dilution; cat #560216, BD Biosciences), RUNX3 (1:40 dilution; cat #MAB3765, R&D Systems), and phospho-histone H2A.X (Ser139) (1:50 dilution; cat #9718, Cell Signaling) after paraformaldehyde fixation and permeabilization with 90% ice-cold methanol (for PKCth and H2A.X) or saponin (for RUNX3) as specified by the manufacturer. Where applicable, we also used fluorchrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100 dilution, Biolegend). To assess ROS levels, we stained live cells with 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2-DCFDA), dihydroethidine (DHE), or Mitosox according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). We measured cell proliferation by BrdU incorporation according to the manufacturer's instructions (BrdU kit, BD Biosciences). We measured cell viability by propidium iodide exclusion. We performed FACS analysis and sorting on FACS Calibur, Canto2, Vantage DiVa, and Aria2 cytometers (BD Biosciences). We analyzed flow cytometry data using FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Quantitative PCR
We extracted total RNA after cell lysis in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). We generated first strand cDNA by reverse transcription with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) using a mix of random 15-mer and anchored oligo(dT) primers, then amplified product by quantitative real-time PCR using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) and a Bio-Rad Chromo4 optical detector. Specific primer sequences are available upon request. We assayed each sample in triplicate and calculated expression levels by the DDCt method with normalization to b-actin.
Western Blot and Immunofluorescence
To generate whole cell lysates, we washed cells in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed them in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:500 dilution; cat #539134, Calbiochem). We ran whole cell lysates on SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred them to Hybond-ECL membranes (Amersham). We blocked membranes with 5% nonfat dry milk, then probed with primary antibodies against PKCth (1:500 dilution; cat #2059, Cell Signaling), RUNX1 (1:1,000 dilution; cat #39000, Active Motif), RUNX3 (1:1,000 dilution; cat #MAB3765, R&D), ERK2 (1:1,000 dilution; cat #sc-154, Santa Cruz), b-actin (1:6,000 dilution; cat #A1978, Sigma), and tubulin (1:5,000 dilution; cat #MAB3408, Chemicon). We used HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000-1:10,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoLaboratories) with enhanced chemiluminescence (cat #32106, Pierce) and detected signals by autoradiography. We quantified band intensities using ImageJ software54.
We performed immunofluorescence on formaldehyde-fixed, methanol-permeabilized cells from cytospin preparations using PKCth primary antibody (1:25 dilution; cat #2059, Cell Signaling) followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100 dilution; cat #A-11008, Invitrogen) and DAPI counterstaining. We acquired images using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope with 20X and 40X objectives.
ChIP-Seq
We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with the ChIP Assay kit (Millipore). Briefly, we treated cells with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 37 degC, lysed them in 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50mM Tris (pH 8.1), and sonicated them to obtain DNA fragments from 200-600bp. We then immunoprecipitated chromatin with the following antibodies: RUNX1 (cat #ab23980, Abcam), Notch1 (Tc)55, CSL (kind gift of Dr. Elliott Kieff), H3K4me1 (cat #ab8895, Abcam), H3K4me3 (cat #07-745, Millipore), and H3K27me3 (cat #07-449, Millipore). Following overnight incubation with antisera at 4 degC, we captured immunoprecipitated chromatin with Protein A-agarose beads which we subsequently washed and eluted bound chromatin. After reversal of cross-links, we purified DNA using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). We prepared ChIP-Seq libraries according to the Illumina ChIP DNA library preparation kit. Following addition of adaptors, we amplified libraries by 18 cycles of PCR, size selected (150-250 bp) by electrophoresis, and purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit. Following quality control testing on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, we subjected the library to deep sequencing using an Illumina Genome Analyzer II in the Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Core facility. We aligned sequencing reads to human genome build hg19 and analyzed using CisGenome56. Mapped reads ranged from 1 x 107 to 3.4 x 107 per library.
Microarray Data Analysis
We downloaded normalized datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and analyzed them using dChip software57.
Statistics
We analyzed quantitative data using GraphPad Prism 5 software. We calculated LIC frequencies from limiting dilution transplant results as described58.
