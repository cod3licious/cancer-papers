Supplemental Figure S1. (a-c) Relative mRNA expression of BCR (a) NF-kB (b) and MYC (c) signature genes (identified in 5) in purified CLL cells (CD19+) of eleven patients assessed on day 29 compared to pre-treatment and normalized to the VCP housekeeping gene. Shown is the mean change (+- SEM) in the expression of each gene in the signature across all patients.
