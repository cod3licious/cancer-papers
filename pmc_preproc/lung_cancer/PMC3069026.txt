Previous Lung Diseases and Lung Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review
and Meta-Analysis. Background In order to review the epidemiologic evidence concerning previous lung diseases as risk factors for lung cancer, a meta-analysis and systematic review was conducted.   Methods Relevant studies were identified through MEDLINE searches. Using random effects models, summary effects of specific previous conditions were evaluated separately and combined. Stratified analyses were conducted based on smoking status, gender, control sources and continent.   Results A previous history of COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema conferred relative risks (RR) of 2.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66, 2.97) (from 16 studies), 1.52 (95% CI: 1.25, 1.84) (from 23 studies) and 2.04 (95% CI: 1.72, 2.41) (from 20 studies), respectively, and for all these diseases combined 1.80 (95% CI: 1.60, 2.11) (from 39 studies). The RR of lung cancer for subjects with a previous history of pneumonia was 1.43 (95% CI: 1.22-1.68) (from 22 studies) and for subjects with a previous history of tuberculosis was 1.76 (95% CI = 1.49, 2.08), (from 30 studies). Effects were attenuated when restricting analysis to never smokers only for COPD/emphysema/chronic bronchitis (RR = 1.22, 0.97-1.53), however remained significant for pneumonia 1.36 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.69) (from 8 studies) and tuberculosis 1.90 (95% CI: 1.45, 2.50) (from 11 studies).   Conclusions Previous lung diseases are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer with the evidence among never smokers supporting a direct relationship between previous lung diseases and lung cancer.

Introduction
Lung Cancer is the most common cancer and the overall leading cause of
cancer-related mortality worldwide leading to greater than a million deaths
annually [1].
Recent evidence suggests that inflammatory processes may play a central role
in carcinogenesis [2],[3],[4],[5].
Previous lung diseases/conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) (emphysema and chronic bronchitis), pneumonia and tuberculosis are
major sources of inflammation in lung tissue [6], [7]. These
conditions may act as intermediates or catalysts in the development of lung
neoplasms and appear to be related to lung cancer development through common
etiologies and/or exposures [8].
The combined prevalence of previous lung conditions is high across populations
and as such they may be important sources of increased lung cancer risk [9],[10], particularly among never smokers.
The associations between COPD, (emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis), pneumonia
and tuberculosis and lung cancer have been investigated previously, however,
the evidence is inconclusive due to inconsistent findings and small sample
sizes - 65% of the studies identified having less than 500 cases. We
therefore conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature in order
to conduct a meta-analysis of the associations between COPD, emphysema, chronic
bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis and lung cancer risk. The main issue in
investigating previous lung diseases and lung cancer risk is the possible
confounding by smoking. In this analysis, we focused on the direct effects
of disease by addressing the potential role of confounding from smoking in
these associations with lung cancer. This was assessed through study eligibility
and subgroup analysis in studies of never smokers.
Previous Lung Diseases
COPD is characterized by airflow obstruction in the lungs and the related
symptoms that impede the normal expiratory volume of the lungs [11]. COPD most commonly refers
to patients with emphysema (the enlargement and destruction of the alveoli)
and/or chronic bronchitis (chronic inflammation and scarring of bronchi) [12]. The condition
has been defined in several ways, and the differences in definitions and diagnosis
affect the estimates of the burden of the disease. The most common definitions
involve either airflow limitation (American Thoracic Society) or reduced maximum
expiratory flow (European Respiratory Society) which is progressive and mostly
irreversible. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
defines the disease in stages of clinical severity based on forced expiratory
volume (FEV1 & FEV1/FVC) from post-bronchodilator
spirometry [13].
The disease affects a large proportion of adults with prevalence estimates
varying from 4.3% to 5.9% in the US adult population [14]. COPD has been associated
with active tobacco smoking (attributable risk estimates in the range of 45%
(UK) and 50% (US) among adults) [15], [16], however,
chronic bronchitis and less frequently emphysema are also observed among lifetime
nonsmokers (chronic bronchitis prevalence among nonsmokers varies across populations
6.3-12.1% [17], [18]). The incidence
rate of COPD among never smokers increases with age to approximately 10-12%
by age 75 in males and to approximately 20% in by age 75 in females [19].
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs and respiratory tract most often
caused by viruses, bacteria and other organisms. Infection is quite common
among adults and pneumonia incidence is highest in the elderly and very young
where immune systems are compromised. The highest hospital discharge rate
for pneumonia per age group in the US was among those 65 and over at 221.3
per 10,000 [20].
The most common method of clinical diagnosis for pneumonia employs the use
of serum antibody determination, particularly microimmunofluorescence [21].
Tuberculosis, another type of infection affecting the lungs is caused by
mycobacteria, predominantly Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The incidence of tuberculosis
among industrialized countries is approximately 23 cases per 100,000, much
lower than the 100-230 cases per 100,000 in other developing countries [22], [23]. Although
mortality due to tuberculosis is low in industrialized countries, inflammation
and ensuing lung remodeling has been hypothesized to lead to lung cancer development [24], [25], [26].

Materials and Methods
Literature Review
We conducted a literature search using the MEDLINE database (US National
Library of Medicine) from January 1960 to August 2010 to obtain a comprehensive
list of publications containing risk estimates describing the association
between lung cancer and previous lung diseases including COPD, emphysema,
chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and tuberculosis. Two independent reviewers
conducted literatures searches and data abstraction. We utilized the Medical
Subject Headings "COPD" or "chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease" or "emphysema" or "chronic bronchitis"
or "pneumonia" or "tuberculosis" or "respiratory
tract diseases" or "lung diseases" and "lung neoplasm"
or the text word terms "previous lung disease" and "lung
cancer". Titles and abstract were reviewed for article relevance. In
the detailed review of relevant papers effect estimates were extracted including
odds ratios, relative risks (RR), hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding
95% confidence intervals from all included studies. When the same population
was examined in multiple publications, we included only the estimate with
the largest number of cases reported. Where studies reported estimates for
both the total population and among only never smokers within that population [17], [28], [29], [30],
the total population estimates were used to combine estimates in all cases
except subgroup analysis among never smokers.
Studies were excluded if (i) estimates were not adjusted for smoking status [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38] given the strong potential
for confounding by smoking; (ii) effect estimates for individual conditions
were not reported in the paper [39], [40]; (iii)
estimates were based on symptoms only rather than the actual diagnoses [41], [42]; (iv) no diagnostic cut
point was provided that could be used to combine the studies (e.g., only estimates
for percentiles of lung function scores compared with the reference group
of highest lung function were provided) [43], [44].
Given that COPD is a term generally used to describe emphysema and chronic
bronchitis, the inflammation and enlargement of air sacs in the lungs, resulting
in reduced or limited airflow [12],
the meta-analysis was based on estimates reported for these three conditions/classifications
combined as well as reported separately (i.e., COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis).
Data collection and diagnostic criteria varied across studies and conditions.
For COPD, most of the studies collected data based on self-reported condition
from questionnaires (i.e. "Did a doctor ever diagnosis you with...?"),
while four several used 1-second forced expiratory volume over forced vital
capacity (FEV1/FVC) or the percent of the predicted forced expiratory
volume in 1 second (% FEV1) [45], [46], [47], [48], [49]. Emphysema
was defined in most studies by self-reported condition, however, a small number
of studies employed either quantitative CT scan [45], [50] or radiographic
evidence [51].
Pneumonia was defined by self-reported condition or by microimmunofluorescence [52], [53], [54], [55] examining
for the levels of IgA antibodies for the C. pneumoniae bacteria.
Tuberculosis was assessed by self-reported history or X-ray [56].
Statistical Methods
Random effects models were employed for all meta-analyses [57]. For all previous lung diseases
and all subgroups, the potential for publication bias was evaluated by funnel
plots and the methods described by Egger [58]
et al and Begg et al [59].
Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochrane's Q-statistic test [60] and the I2
statistic [61].
Where there was evidence of heterogeneity across studies, the source of heterogeneity
was evaluated by meta-regression (Continent, smoking status, diagnostic method,
gender, date study completed, study design and control type used as predictors)
and by stratified analysis on smoking status, type of controls, method of
diagnosis, study period and gender. If the heterogeneity could not be accounted
for by the different characteristics, an influence analysis was conducted
to evaluate the source of heterogeneity from single studies by a Galbraith
plot and evaluating changes in Q statistics upon study removal. Analyses were
also conducted based on "never smokers only" to eliminate possible
confounding by smoking. Studies are classified as never smokers where the
population consisted exclusively of never smokers by design. A latency analysis
was conducted based on study eligibility where studies that excluded persons
with a lung disease diagnosis >2, >10 and >20 years before diagnosis
were examined across groups. Analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
Software Version 2 (CMA, NJ), and STATA software version 10 (STATA, College
Station TX).

Results
In total 39 studies were identified that examined the effects of COPD,
chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema with estimates adjusted for smoking (Table S1).
Specifically, there were 16 studies with estimates of COPD on lung cancer
risk; 20 with emphysema and 23 with chronic bronchitis (59 total estimates
based on 39 studies). Among the 39 studies, there were 18 population-based
and 12 hospital-based case-control studies, 1 mixed case-control study and
8 cohort studies. Out of the 39 studies, 13 studies presented estimates among
never smokers only, which reported 23 estimates for various conditions. For
pneumonia we identified 22 studies in total, including 10 studies with never
smokers only. For tuberculosis, we identified a total of 30 studies including
12 studies with populations of never smokers.
COPD/emphysema/chronic bronchitis
Thirty-nine studies examined the relationship between COPD and/or chronic
bronchitis and/or emphysema and lung cancer while adjusting for smoking (Table S1).
Nineteen of the studies were conducted in North America [17], [29], [30], [39], [45], [46], [48], [51], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], 12 were conducted
in Asia [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], 6 in Europe [28], [47], [50], [85], [86], [87]
and 1 in Africa [88].
The combined relative risk (RR) of lung cancer based on all 59 effect estimates
was 1.83 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60, 2.11). Figure 1 displays a forest plot of the association
with estimates separated by each condition (chronic bronchitis, emphysema,
COPD as reported in the publication) as well as all conditions combined. It
is noteworthy that in examining only those studies that employed a physiological
diagnosis of COPD from FEV testing or radiographic evidence of emphysema,
the RR was elevated compared to self-reported diagnoses (RR = 2.64,
95% CI: 2.01, 3.47). Among never smokers we did not observe a significant
association of all COPD, emphysema and chronic bronchitis estimates combined
(RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.53), however, when
the outlying study was removed from the analysis, the effect was 1.29, 95%
CI: 1.02-1.63.

for one population in study combined among males and females (no combined

estimates from a subgroup of never smokers presented in the manuscript which
were not included in the overall estimates.
In terms of disease-specific estimates, the overall RRs for of COPD, emphysema
and chronic bronchitis were 2.22 (95% CI: 1.66, 2.97), 2.04 (95%
CI: 1.72, 2.41) and 1.52 (95% CI: 1.25, 1.84), respectively. When restricted
to never smokers, associations were not significant for emphysema based on
8 studies (RR = 1.50, 95% CI: 0.96, 2.36), or
for chronic bronchitis based on 12 studies (RR = 1.18,
95% CI: 0.88, 1.58). Since passive smoking may confound the association
between COPD and lung cancer, sensitivity analyses focused on the four studies
that adjusted for SHS exposure [17], [64], [66], [74].
Pooling estimates for COPD, chronic bronchitis/emphysema, chronic bronchitis
or emphysema among never smokers adjusted for passive smoking, the RR was
1.49, 95% CI: 1.20, 1.85) (data not shown). Significant heterogeneity
was observed among estimates across studies all 59 estimates as well as among
several subgroups including when stratified by control type, there was also
significant heterogeneity among different control types and when stratified
by smoking status (Table 1).
When comparing across pooled estimates, significant heterogeneity was observed
between control types (p = 0.009) and between continents
(p<.001). Meta-regression suggested that study design, control type, smoking
status and diagnostic method were predictors of effect size and contributed
to heterogeneity (p<0.05). Continent, gender and time of study did not
contribute to heterogeneity (Results not shown, disease specific Galbraith
plots included in Figures
S1, S2, S3, S4). Tests
for publication bias among all estimates combined were suggestive of an absence
of smaller studies for COPD (Figures
S7, S8, S9, S10). To
summarize, the pooled estimates among studies examining COPD, emphysema and
chronic bronchitis suggest that these factors are associated with a significantly
increased risk of lung cancer. Among studies examining never smokers, significant
effects were not observed, however, were when one outlying study was removed
and among those studies of never smokers that adjusted for SHS exposure. Heterogeneity
was observed overall, however, differences across studies can be at least
partially explained by study design, control type, smoking status and diagnostic
method.
Pneumonia
Twenty-two studies examined the relationship between pneumonia and lung
cancer risk while adjusting for smoking (Table S1). Eleven studies were conducted in
North America [17], [53], [63], [64], [65], [67], [68], [69], [70], [84], [89], 7 in Europe [27], [52], [54], [85], [86], [90], [91], and 4 in
East Asia [73], [74], [79], [84].
A significant increase in lung cancer risk was observed among all studies
(overall RR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.68). The effect
was similar for all studies combined compared to studies with never smokers
only (RR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.69).
The combined effects across all studies separated by participant smoking
status are displayed in forest plot format in Figure
2. There was no evidence suggestive of publication bias for this association
(Table 1, Funnel plot
included in Figure
S11). There was significant heterogeneity across all studies (p<.001,
Galbraith plot included in Figure
S5). However, the heterogeneity diminished when restricting the analysis
to never smokers (p = 0.13). Meta-regression suggested
that study design, and continent were predictors of effect size and contributed
to heterogeneity (p<0.05). In summary, a previous diagnosis of pneumonia
across studies was associated with increased lung cancer risk independent
of smoking status, with no evidence of publication bias.

estimates from a subgroup of never smokers presented in the manuscript which
were not included in the overall estimates.
Tuberculosis
Thirty studies examined the relationship between tuberculosis and lung
cancer while adjusting for smoking (Table S1). Eleven of the studies were conducted
in the North America [17], [29], [39], [56], [62], [63], [64], [65], [67], [69], [70], 15 were conducted in
Asia [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [83], [84], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96] and 4 were
conducted in Europe [27], [85], [86], [90].
The observed effect across all the identified studies suggests an increased
risk of lung cancer from tuberculosis (RR = 1.76, 95%
CI: 1.49, 2.08). The effect was similar for all studies when compared to only
never smokers with the effect of tuberculosis among never smokers being slightly
elevated (RR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.50). The
combined effects across all studies as well as separated by participant smoking
status are displayed in forest plot format in Figure
3. The gender specific results showed very similar effects for men
and women. Heterogeneity was observed across all tuberculosis studies combined
(p<.001, Galbraith plot included in Figure S6) as well as among studies that examined
populations of smokers (p<.001). Among never smokers, no heterogeneity
was observed (p = 0.29). Publication bias was observed
across all studies of tuberculosis (Funnel plot included in Figure S12), however, not among studies examining
never smokers. In summary, a previous diagnosis of tuberculosis was associated
with increased lung cancer risk across studies independent of smoking. Heterogeneity
was observed across all studies, however, can be partially attributed to differences
in controls, continent and smoking status and gender of participants (Table 1).

from a subgroup of never smokers presented in the manuscript which were not
included in the overall estimates.

Discussion
In this meta-analysis, an increased risk of lung cancer was observed for
COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and tuberculosis when examining
the studies that adjusted analyses for smoking. Of particular interest are
the significant effects also observed among never smokers for pneumonia and
tuberculosis. For chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the combined estimates
were lower among never smokers, indicating that residual confounding from
tobacco may explain some of the effect among smokers, however, does not appear
to fully explain the association.
We estimated the combined effects of previous lung diseases on lung cancer
risk in studies where effects were adjusted for smoking. Although, the precision
of adjustment varied from study to study as seen in the detailed adjustment
column of the study table, in essence the estimates provided in this meta-analysis
represent the direct effects of the diseases adjusted for smoking status.
It is possible that residual confounding of smoking could account for part
of the association observed. Nevertheless, the effects among never smokers
suggest these previous lung diseases such as pneumonia and tuberculosis have
independent effect on lung cancer risk.
It is difficult to conclude from our results whether it is indeed the inflammatory
sequelae of these diseases that increase lung cancer risk or whether it is
the pathogenesis of the diseases themselves. While it is likely that the diseases
of interest in this investigation act in different biological causal pathways,
if acting independent of tobacco exposure, however, the inflammatory response
is the most likely common causal link [97].
There are several sources of bias that must be addressed in the conduct
and design of the individual studies as well as in the synthesis of the studies.
The majority of studies reported were case-control studies in which data concerning
previous lung diseases were abstracted or collected via questionnaire post
lung cancer diagnosis. It is possible that the conditions were early manifestations
or symptoms of lung cancer that were mis-diagnosed particularly for emphysema
and chronic bronchitis. This is less probable for pneumonia or tuberculosis,
however, tumors may have been interpreted as lesions from infections prior
to cancer diagnoses.
As an inherited limitation of case-control studies, differential recall
bias may account for part of the association observed. However, the issues
of misclassification and recall bias can be adequately addressed in the cohort
studies included in the analyses. Also, several of the cohort studies employed
quantitative diagnostic tools such as a measure of forced expiratory volume
to diagnose COPD. This may have reduced the potential for misclassification
bias. Among these studies the effects were stronger than the results based
on the self-reported medical history, suggesting that recall or misclassification
bias do not explain the association with COPD and may in fact underestimate
the true effect. A previous meta-analysis of exclusively FEV1 among
prospective studies with over 5,000 participants calculated a combined estimate
of 2.23 fold (95% CI: 1.93, 8.25) when comparing the highest quintile
of FEV1 to the lowest among the 4 studies included [98].
Several additional sources of potential biases are noteworthy within the
individual studies. The prevalence of previous lung diseases among controls
was often much higher than the baseline rates reported in the general population,
particularly in those studies conducted in China, in which 9% [84] and 14% [92] prevalence
as opposed to a point prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis of 573 (95%
CI 472-631) per 100 000 (1% prevalence) in a population survey
conducted by the China Tuberculosis Control Collaboration [99] and a lifetime prevalence of
less than 1% in the cohort examined [94].
This suggests the potential for selection or recall biases in these studies.
Several studies used both direct and next of kin interviews, potentially leading
to differential recall bias as next of kin of the deceased may have excessively
ruminated over questions leading to a higher likelihood of a positive response
among cases. It should also be noted that COPD may be under-diagnosed in North
America [100].
Reverse causality must also be considered in the cases of pneumonia and
tuberculosis as infections may have been the result of a weakened immune system
due to lung cancer. For these conditions, ascertainment bias must also be
considered as individuals with tuberculosis or pneumonia may have been more
likely diagnosed with lung cancer due to the use of additional chest x-rays
in the diagnostic work-up often used for the infections. The possibility of
reverse causality was addressed in several studies by examining the time of
infection prior to cancer diagnosis. Significant increases in risk were consistent
in latency analyses even at greater than 10-20 years since diagnosis
of TB [74], [92], [94]. Combining the latency evidence,
although not perfectly consistent and comparable across studies, suggests
that the diseases of interest are related to lung cancer risk after long exclusion/latency
periods. Among those studies that included latency analyses [27], [28], [30], [47], [64], [65], [67], [68], [70], [74], [89], [92], we observed
elevated estimates for >10 and >20 years prior to cancer diagnosis for
chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis and chronic bronchitis, emphysema and COPD
combined. For emphysema and pneumonia elevated estimates for >10 years
were observed (results not shown), however not for >20 years. It is worth
noting that only 20-30% of studies included, depending on the
disease, conducted such analyses, therefore results should be cautiously interpreted.
Although histology patterns of lung cancer have changed over time in the last
few decades, we did not see any difference in the effects stratified by study
period. (results not shown).
It is also possible that our results, particularly among never smokers,
may have been due to confounding from another source such as second hand smoke
(SHS). SHS has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer [101] and may be related to previous
lung diseases [102].
The majority of the case-control studies examining the effects among never
smokers have adjusted their analyses for SHS in an attempt to control for
potential confounding, nevertheless, the possibility of residual confounding
cannot be excluded. Also, occupational exposures may have acted as confounders
in the associations tested as they have been associated with lung cancer [103], particularly
among never smokers.
We found minimal evidence of publication bias for pneumonia using standard
methodologies. Publication bias may have occurred in the examination of the
previous respiratory conditions of interest as many studies only reported
results for those conditions that showed a significant association. It appears
that for COPD a surplus of large positive studies or a dearth of smaller negative
studies lead to significant tests. Publication bias was suggested for tuberculosis.
This may be attributable to several of the smaller Asian studies reporting
very large effect estimates. Another possibility is that Asian studies where
small or null effects were observed not being published in English journals
and as such omitted from this data collection.
The previous lung diseases examined in this meta-analysis as a group affect
a large population of individuals. In the United States, the conditions have
a prevalence of: for emphysema 18.5 per 1000 people, for chronic bronchitis
43.0 per 1000 [9]
and tuberculosis 4.8 per 100,00 [10]
and although the actual incidence of pneumonia in the US is unknown there
were an estimated 1.4 million hospital discharges from pneumonia infections
in 2005 [104].
The positive associations between these conditions and lung cancer risk are
of substantial public health importance due to the large population exposed.
In conclusion, we observed a consistent positive association between COPD,
emphysema, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and tuberculosis and lung cancer
risk in this meta-analysis. The observation of consistent associations when
effects were examined among studies of never smoking cases supports a direct
association between the conditions and lung cancer, reducing the likelihood
of confounding by tobacco exposure. The most likely explanation for the increased
risk associated with these diseases is the inflammatory effects within lung
tissue. Previous lung conditions are known to induce an inflammatory response
in the lung [7].
Recent evidence has suggested that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the
development of lung cancer [97], [105], [106], particularly
among never smokers. Inflammation may increase the risk of cancer development
as an initiator or promoter through three processes; increased genetic mutations,
anti-apoptotic signaling [107]
and increased angiogenesis [8].
Further investigations into the potentially causal mechanisms whereby these
conditions, promote lung cancer development are warranted. As such, larger
studies or pooled analyses with the ability for standardized adjustment and
more detailed subgroup analyses would be better suited to address these issues.
