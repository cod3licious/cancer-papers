N-Methylpurine DNA Glycosylase and OGG1 DNA Repair Activities: Opposite Associations With Lung Cancer Risk. Only a minority of smokers develop lung cancer, possibly due to genetic predisposition, including DNA repair deficiencies. To examine whether inter-individual variations in DNA repair activity of N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG) are associated with lung cancer, we conducted a blinded, population-based, case-control study with 100 lung cancer case patients and 100 matched control subjects and analyzed the data with conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. MPG enzyme activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from case patients was higher than in control subjects, results opposite that of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) DNA repair enzyme activity. For lung cancer associated with one standard deviation increase in MPG activity, the adjusted odds ratio was 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2 to 2.6; P = .006). A combined MPG and OGG1 activities score was more strongly associated with lung cancer risk than either activity alone, with an odds ratio of 2.3 (95% CI = 1.4 to 3.6; P < .001). These results form a basis for a future panel of risk biomarkers for lung cancer risk assessment and prevention.
