PRC2 overexpression and PRC2-target gene repression relating to poorer prognosis in small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a subtype of lung cancer with poor prognosis. Expression array analysis of 23 SCLC cases and 42 normal tissues revealed that EZH2 and other PRC2 members were highly expressed in SCLC. ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 suggested that genes with H3K27me3(+) in SCLC were extended not only to PRC2-target genes in ES cells but also to other target genes such as cellular adhesion-related genes. These H3K27me3(+) genes in SCLC were repressed significantly, and introduction of the most repressed gene JUB into SCLC cell line lead to growth inhibition. Shorter overall survival of clinical SCLC cases correlated to repression of JUB alone, or a set of four genes including H3K27me3(+) genes. Treatment with EZH2 inhibitors, DZNep and GSK126, resulted in growth repression of SCLC cell lines. High PRC2 expression was suggested to contribute to gene repression in SCLC, and may play a role in genesis of SCLC.

Results
Microarray expression analysis in SCLC and normal tissues
Gene expressions in 23 clinical SCLC samples and 42 normal tissues including the normal lung were analyzed on genome-wide scale using microarray, and average expression levels of SCLC were compared to those of normal tissues. Among 11,037 genes with Genechip score >200 in at least one sample, 71 genes showed higher expression in SCLC by >10-fold compared to normal tissues (Supplementary Table S1). The most highly expressed genes in SCLC samples included GRP, INSM1 and ASCL1, which were reported to be highly expressed in classic type SCLC with neuroendocrine features232425, TOP2A, which encodes a DNA topoisomerase active in fast-growing tumors and is a target of chemotherapy in SCLC26, and EZH2, a member of PRC2 and a methyltransferase for histone H3 lysine K27 (Fig. 1). Other PRC2 members, SUZ12 and EED, were also highly expressed in SCLC compared to the normal tissues. The expression levels of PRC2 members in SCLC were also significantly higher than squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Mapping of histone modification
We performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 mark in three SCLC cell lines and in SAEC, and obtained 9280, 9352, 15704 and 7589 peaks in Lu130, H209, DMS53, and SAEC, respectively (Fig. 2a). We then prepared ChIP samples by additionally performed ChIP experiments, and performed quantitative ChIP-PCR to validate ChIP-seq results (Fig. 2b). To confirm overlapping of H3K27me3(+) regions and PRC2-target regions, we also performed ChIP-seq for SUZ12 in a SCLC cell line Lu130. SUZ12(+) regions were well-overlapped to H3K27me3(+) regions as reported2728 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Genes with and without H3K27me3 around promoter region (within +- 2kb from transcription start site) were regarded as H3K27me3(+) and H3K27me3(-) genes, respectively. When expression levels of H3K27me3(+) genes were compared to H3K27me3(-) genes within each sample, H3K27me3(+) genes showed significant repression: 0.11-fold in SAEC, 0.27-fold in Lu130, 0.08-fold in H209, and 0.11-fold in DMS53 (P < 1 x 10-20, t-test), confirming that ChIP-seq analysis for H3K27me3 was properly performed (Fig. 2c).
These H3K27me3(+) genes were compared with reported PRC2-target genes in ES cells28. Genes with H3K27me3 in SAEC only or genes with H3K27me3 in both SAEC and SCLC cell lines, showed significant overlap with PRC2-target genes in ES cells. Genes with H3K27me3 in SCLC cell lines but not in SAEC, however, were not significantly overlapped with PRC2-target genes in ES cells (Fig. 2d).
Genes repressed with H3K27me3 in SCLC
The 8,654 genes showing H3K27me3(-) in 3 SCLC cell lines and also H3K27me3(-) in SAEC (SCLC(3-)SAEC(-) genes), showed similar expression levels among SAEC, 3 SCLC cell lines, the normal lung, other normal tissues, and clinical SCLC cases (Fig. 3a). But the 644 genes showing H3K27me3(+) in 1 of 3 SCLC cell lines but H3K27me3(-) in SAEC (SCLC(1+)SAEC(-) genes), showed lower expression levels in SCLC cell lines as well as clinical SCLC cases compared to the SCLC(3-)SAEC(-) genes. The 343 genes showing H3K27me3(+) in 2 or 3 SCLC cell lines but H3K27me3(-) in SAEC (SCLC(2or3+)SAEC(-) genes), showed further reduced expression levels in SCLC cell lines as well as clinical SCLC cases compared to the SCLC(3-)SAEC(-) genes. These data indicated that genes with H3K27me3(+) in SCLC cell lines were significantly repressed not only in the analyzed SCLC cell lines, but also in clinical SCLC samples (Fig. 3a).
When genes were sorted by fold expression level between SAEC and mean of 3 SCLC cell lines in descending order, the SCLC (2or3+)SAEC(-) genes were significantly enriched downward (P < 1 x 10-15, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), i.e. were significantly repressed in SCLC cell lines (Fig. 3b). The 343 SCLC(2or3+) SAEC(-) genes showed significant enrichment of GO-terms e.g. immune response (P = 5.1 x 10-14), cell adhesion (P = 1.7 x 10-8) and other similar terms in Biological Process, which were different from GO-terms of PRC2-target genes in ES cells related to differentiation and development. Extracellular region (P = 1.3 x 10-23), plasma membrane (P = 8.1 x 10-21) and other similar GO-terms were enriched in Cellular Component (Fig. 3c).
Introduction of repressed genes in SCLC cell line
Genes possessing H3K27me3 mark in all the three SCLC cell lines, and relating to the four GO-terms of immune response, cell adhesion, extracellular region, or plasma membrane, were sorted by fold expression level between SAEC and mean of 3 SCLC cell lines in descending order (Fig. 4a). The most repressed genes were JUB and PTRF, which showed decreased expression to 0.01-fold in SCLC cell lines compared to SAEC, and H3K27me3 mark specifically in SCLC cell lines (Fig. 4b). These two genes were introduced in an SCLC cell line DMS53 using lentiviral system, and the protein expressions were confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. S3). JUB was distributed to the cellular membrane, while PTRF was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5b). Introduction of JUB inhibited cellular growth, whereas introduction of PTRF did not affect cellular growth (Fig. 5c), suggesting that the most repressed gene related to cell adhesion, JUB, might function as a growth-suppressor in SCLC cells and its repression by PRC2 might contribute to genesis of SCLC.
JUB repression correlated to shorter survival
Since gene repression by PRC2 was suggested to contribute to genesis of SCLC, we wanted to analyze whether the repression correlated to poorer prognosis of clinical SCLC or not. We therefore examined the dependency of overall survival time on JUB and other highly repressed PRC-target genes (PTRF, DMKN, AXL, EPHB4) (Fig. 4a) as well as highly expressed PRC2 complex genes (EZH2, SUZ12, EED) and also highly expressed classic type marker genes (GRP, INSM1, ASCL1) (Fig. 1a), using the Cox proportional-hazards regression. Repression of JUB or EPHB4 showed strong correlation to shorter survival (P = 0.002 or P = 0.007, respectively), while high expression of classic type marker, GRP, also correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.02) (Fig. 6a). The most relevant predictor variables were analyzed by the AIC based criteria, the stepAIC function of R software, and a set of four genes, JUB, EPHB4, GRP and ASCL1, was selected as the most relevant one (P = 0.0001) among all the possible combination of one through 11 genes. The K-means sample clustering with the four genes using Orange software29 showed that the optimal cluster size was two, and the two groups of samples were shown by the multi dimensional scaling plot (Fig. 6b). The one group (namely Group-L) could be simply characterized with low JUB and high GRP expression, and the other one (namely Group-H), opposite (Fig. 6c). To analyze whether the classification into the two clusters reflect distinct prognosis, Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis was also performed. Group-L showed shorter overall survival than Group-H (P = 0.02, log-rank test) (Fig. 6d).
To confirm the robustness of the set of four genes to classify SCLC, we analyzed reported RNA-seq data of SCLC14. The optimal cluster size was again two, revealed by the K-means sample clustering with the four genes using Orange29, and the two groups of samples were shown by the multi dimensional scaling plot (Supplementary Fig. S4a). Again, the Group-L could be simply characterized with low JUB and high GRP expressions, and the Group-H, opposite (Supplementary Fig. S4b).
Treatment of SCLC cell lines with EZH2 inhibitors
To get insight into clinical application of EZH2 inhibitors on SCLC, we next analyzed effect of an EZH2 inhibitor, DZNep3031, on the three SCLC cell lines in vitro. When SCLC cell lines were treated with 5 mM DZNep for 5-6 days, western blot analysis showed decrease of EZH2 protein level (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. S5), which is consistent with the previous report32. WST-8 assay showed repression of cellular growth in the three SCLC cell lines, suggesting that EZH2 inhibitors might be effective for therapy on SCLC.
SCLC cell lines were then treated with a selective EZH2 inhibitor, GSK126, at different doses of 0.5, 2, and 8 mM (Fig. 7b). All the three cell lines showed substantial inhibition of cellular growth at high dose (8 mM). Although DMS53 was not sensitive to lower doses (0.5 mM and 2 mM), growth inhibition was observed in part at lower doses in Lu130 and H209.

Discussion
We here report high expression levels of EZH2 and other PRC2 components in SCLC. Genes targeted by PRC2 in SCLC cell lines were shown to be repressed in SCLC cell lines and clinical SCLC samples. While JUB is the most repressed gene with H3K27me3 mark in all the three SCLC cell lines, JUB introduction lead to growth inhibition of SCLC cells. Shorter overall survival of clinical SCLC cases significantly correlated to lower expression of JUB alone (P = 0.002), or a set of PRC2 target genes (JUB, EPHB4) and classic type marker genes (GRP, ASCL1) (P = 0.0001). Treatment of three SCLC cell lines with EZH2 inhibitors, DZNep and GSK126, induced growth inhibition. These data suggested that high expression of PRC2 contributed to gene repression in SCLC, and the repression may play a role in worse prognosis of SCLC.
PRC2 complex has a histone methyltransferase activity and represses gene expression by methylation of H3K27 residue. PRC2-target genes in ES cells28 show enrichment of genes related to development and differentiation, and repression of those genes in ES cells or adult tissue stem cells plays a role in maintenance of stemness33. In this study, genes with H3K27me3 in SAEC only and genes with H3K27me3 both in SAEC and SCLC cells were significantly overlapped with PRC2-target genes in ES cells, and showed enrichment of GO-terms such as development and differentiation, similar to PRC2-target genes in ES cells. Genes with H3K27me3 in SCLC cells but not in SAEC, however, were not overlapped with PRC2-target genes in ES cells (Fig. 2d). It might be suggested that H3K27me3 marks in SCLC might be extended to not only PRC2-target genes in ES cells but also other target genes such as cellular adhesion-related genes, due to highly expressed PRC2 components.
It was reported that high expression levels of EZH2 in prostate cancer and breast cancer correlated to metastasis and invasion, and thus poorer prognosis1718. Inhibition of PRC2 by DZNep treatment resulted in growth inhibition of cancer cell lines with high expression of EZH2, compared to normal cell lines. DAB21P and p21CDKN1A were reported to be PRC2 target genes and play a role in these cancers343536. In SCLC, high expression of EZH2 may extend PRC2-target genes including JUB, and its repression in SCLC correlated to poorer prognosis. DZNep treatment of SCLC cell lines also resulted in growth inhibition, while DZNep is known as PRC2 inhibitor3031.
Recently, EZH2-specific inhibitors were reported to be developed and effective to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines3738. Although GSK126 induced loss of H3K27me3 independent of EZH2 mutation status, six of seven lymphoma cell lines sensitive to GSK126 treatment were EZH2-mutation(+), while only two of 11 lymphoma cell lines less sensitive to GSK126 were EZH2-mutation(+). It was suggested that lymphoma cell lines with mutant EZH2 tend to be dependent on EZH2 activity on cell growth37. In our study, two of three SCLC cell lines showed growth inhibition in part at lower doses of GSK126. It might be suggested that elevated EZH2 in SCLC could induce the dependence of cellular growth on EZH2 activity, like the reported seven sensitive lymphoma cell lines (six EZH2-mutation(+) and one EZH2-mutation(-) cells), but that co-occurring alterations could perhaps weaken the dependency on EZH2 in some SCLC cells. PRC2-target medicine may become an important therapeutic strategy against cancer including SCLC, and application of EZH2-specific inhibitors should be further analyzed for SCLC.
While introduction of JUB showed growth suppression, introduction of PTRF had no effect. PTRF as well as CAV1 is known as structural component of caveolae, 50-100 nm flask-shaped invaginations of plasma membrane involved in numerous signal transductions39. Whereas CAV1 was reported as a tumor suppressor4041 and PTRF was required for premature senescence induction through interaction with CAV142, CAV1 was also strongly repressed in the three SCLC cell lines and clinical SCLC samples (Supplementary Fig. 6). Introduction of PTRF together with CAV1 might be necessary to rule out tumor-suppressive function of PTRF in SCLC. Beside JUB and PTRF, genes with H3K27me3 in SCLC but not in SAEC included EPHB4, WNT7A, COL18A1, and THBD (Fig. 4). EPHB4 was reported to be a tumor suppressor gene silenced by DNA hypermethylation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and transduction of EPHB4 resulted in down-regulation of phosphorylated Akt43. WNT7A was reported to be decreased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and its transfection into NSCLC cell lines reversed malignant phenotype44. COL18A1 is cleaved to be Endostatin, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, and systemic administration of recombinant Endostatin inhibited growth of transplanted cancers45. THBD was reported to be a tumor suppressor gene silenced by DNA hypermethylation in cancers4647, and its suppression correlated to tumor invasion and poor prognosis4849. Repression of these genes with H3K27me3 modification may also contribute to genesis of SCLC.
A cell adhesion-related protein JUB harbors LIM domain and is recruited to cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesive complexes to form stable cell-cell junction50. JUB was also reported to bind to PRMT5 and repress SNAIL target genes in the nucleus51, and accumulation of JUB in the nucleus of P19 embryonal cells resulted in growth inhibition and spontaneous endodermal differentiation52. In this study, introduction of JUB in an SCLC cell DMS53 resulted in growth repression, but the protein was distributed mainly to the cellular membrane, not in the nucleus. It is yet to be elucidated whether the protein distributed to cell-cell adhesive complexes functions as growth suppressor.
Classic type of SCLC with neuroendocrine feature is characterized with expression of GRP as well as L-dopa-decarboxylase, neuron specific enolase, and creatine kinase-BB isoenzyme53. ASCL1 is essential for development of neuroendocrine cells and also highly expressed in classic SCLC, and knock-down of ASCL1 inhibited colony formation in soft agar and induced apoptosis in SCLC5455. Whereas JUB repression alone significantly correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.002), SCLC was classified into two groups with distinct prognosis using a set of PRC2 target genes (JUB, EPHB4) and classic type marker genes (GRP, ASCL1), and the group with poorer outcome could be simply characterized with low expression of JUB and high expression of GRP (Fig. 6c). Further study is necessary whether these expressions are independent phenomena or features of classic type SCLC include gene repression with H3K27me3.
In summary, PRC2 components were highly expressed in SCLC and contributed to gene repression, and the repression may play a role in genesis of SCLC.

Methods
Clinical samples and cell lines
Primary SCLC samples were obtained from patients undergoing pulmonary resection at Department of Surgery, Cancer Institute Hospital, with written informed consents. These samples were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80degC. The frozen materials were microscopically examined by two independent pathologists, and were dissected to enrich cancer cells when necessary. Three SCLC cell lines with variable characteristics were prepared: a monolayer cell line DMS53 with wild type RB and missense mutation of p53, a floating cell line Lu130 with wild type RB and missense mutation of p53, and another floating cell line H209 with missense mutation of RB and splice site mutation of p53 (Supplementary Table S2). H209 and DMS53 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and Lu130 was from Riken BioResource Center Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). SAEC was obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Lu130 and H209 were cultured in RPMI1640 containing penicillin and streptomycin, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37degC in 5% CO2. DMS53 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing penicillin and streptomycin, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37degC in 5% CO2. SAEC was cultured according to supplier's instruction using SAGM BulletKit and Reagent Pack (Lonza). This study was certified by Ethics Committee in The University of Tokyo and in the Cancer Institute.
RNA samples
Total RNA of 23 SCLC samples, three SCLC cell lines and SAEC was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA samples of normal tissues to include variety of organs e.g. central nervous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunological, skeletal, reproductive, urinary and circulatory systems, were purchased as follows: whole brain, cerebellum, adrenal gland, salivary gland, trachea, bone marrow, testis from Clontech (Mountain View, CA); cereberal cortex, pons, hippocampus, diencephalon, thalamus, tongue, esophagus, gallbladder, tonsil, artery, vein, adipose, lymph node, seminal vesicle from Biochain (Newark, CA); thymus, ovary, skeletal muscle, heart, small intestine, colon, pancreas, kidney, bladder, spleen, prostate from Ambion (Carlsbad, CA); skin, thyroid, breast, and uterus from Stratagene (Santa Clara, CA). The quality of RNA was controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technology, CA) and high quality RNA with RNA intensity number (RIN) >=7.0 was used for array analysis.
Expression array analysis
For genome-wide transcription analysis, Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays (Fremont, CA) was used. Data were collected and analyzed by GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). The GeneChip data were analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software v1.3 by MAS5 algorithms, to obtain signal value (Genechip score) for each probeset. For global normalization, the average signal in an array was made equal to 100. Expression array data is available at GEO datasets (GSE43346). Expression levels of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung analyzed also using U133 plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays were collected from GEO datasets (GSE2199), and global normalization was done by the same manner.
Gene ontology analysis
Gene annotation enrichment analysis was done for Gene Ontology (biological process and cellular component) using the Functional Annotation tool at DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and were prepared for ChIP. ChIP using H3K27me3 (07-142, Upstate, rabbit polyclonal), or Suz12 (D39F6, Cell Signaling, rabbit monoclonal) antibody was performed as we previously reported56. Briefly, cells were crosslinked with 1% formalin for 10 min, and crosslinked cell lysates underwent fragmentation by sonication and incubated with antibodies bound to protein A-sepharose beads (50% slurry) overnight at 4degC. The beads were washed several times and eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3). The eluates were treated with 1.5 mg of pronase 2 hr at 42degC then incubated at 65degC over night to reverse the crosslinks. The ChIP'ed DNA was purified by phenol/chroloform treatment and precipitated with LiCl and 70% ethanol.
ChIP-sequencing (Chip-seq)
Sample preparation for ChIP-seq was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina), and sequencing was performed using Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx as we previously reported56. Briefly, size fractionated DNA was extracted and a single adenosine was added using Klenow exo- (3' and 5' exo minus; Illumina). Illumina adaptors were then added and DNA was subjected to 20 cycles of PCR according to manufacturer's instructions. We then purified DNA and performed cluster generation and 36 cycles of sequencing on the Illumina cluster station and 1G Analyzer following the manufacturer's instructions. 36-bp single end reads were mapped to the NCBI Build #36 (UCSC hg18) reference human genome, using the Illumina pipeline software version 1.4. The numbers of uniquely mapped reads for SAEC, Lu130, H209 and DMS53 were 19,527,119 (SAEC), 7,543,376 (Lu130), 18,418,930 (H209) and 21,354,066 (DMS53) for H3K27me3, and 20,025,034 (Lu130) for Suz12. Distribution of immunoprecipitated DNA fragments was analyzed using Model-based Analysis for Chip-Seq (MACS)57, with a window of 600 bp. Regions with p < 10-30 and p < 10-10 were regarded as H3K27me3(+) and SUZ12(+) regions, respectively. ChIP-seq data is available at GEO datasets (GSE43346).
Quantitative real-time ChIP-PCR
ChIP samples were amplified by real-time PCR using SYBR Green and iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and quantified by drawing the standard curve using 20, 2, 0.2, and 0.02 ng/mL sonicated genomic DNA of SAEC. The quantity of ChIP'ed DNA was shown as a ratio to Input DNA (Input %). The PCR primers and conditions are shown in Supplementary Table S3.
Lentiviral vectors
To introduce JUB and PTRF in SCLC cell, we constructed lentiviral vectors for JUB and PTRF by cloning full-length cDNAs by reverse-transcription PCR products from SAEC, into a CMV promoter driven expression vector pLentiV5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that contains puromycin resistance gene, and check the sequences. Lentivirus was prepared by transfection of pLentiV5 vector together with pMD2 and psPAX2 vectors in 293T cells. DMS53 was infected with the prepared viruses, and selected using puromycin at 2 ug/mL for two days.
Immunoblot analysis
Aliquots of protein were subjected to SDS/PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against EZH2 (#39103, Active Motif), V5 (R960-25, Invitrogen), and a-Tubulin (DM1A, Sigma) as primary antibodies, and against rabbit IgG (sc-2004, Santa Cruz, 1:5,000 dilution) and mouse IgG (sc-2005, Santa Cruz) as secondary antibodies. The antibodies used were well characterized previously by us and others56. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the resulting immunoblots were visualized using Amersham ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) and LAS-3000 (Fujifilm, Japan), and processed using MultiGauge software (Fujifilm).
Cellular immunofluorescence
Cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. After washed with PBS three times, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Introduced proteins were detected using antibodies against V5 (R960-25, Invitrogen) as primary antibody, and green-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 dye-labeled anti-mouse antibody (A11029, Invitrogen) as secondary antibody. Photographs were taken with Biozero BZ-8100 (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan).
Growth curve
JUB- and PTRF-introduced DMS53 cells were seeded at density of 1 x 103 cells/well in 96-well plate, and cellular growth was analyzed using WST-8 kit (Doijndo, Japan) at 12, 36, 60, and 84 h. Cellular growth of Lu130, H209, and DMS53 with treatment by DZNep or GSK126 (Active Biochem, NJ) was also analyzed using WST-8 kit. DZNep was dissolved in PBS at 5 mM, and cells were cultured at the final concentration of 5 mM. GSK126 was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM, and cells were cultured at 0.5, 2, and 8 mM.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using t-test and Fisher's exact test. K-means sample clustering was performed by Orange29 (http://orange.biolab.si/citation/). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed by JMP 7 (http://www.jmp.com/) and P-value was calculated by log-rank test. Survival analysis by Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed by R software (http://www.R-project.org/). In overall survival analysis, the end of follow up period was 84 months from the primary surgery and the mean follow up time of the cases was 64 months. Death as a result of SCLC was the primary end point and deaths by other causes were censored.
