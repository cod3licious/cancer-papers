Optimized S-Trityl-l-cysteine-Based
Inhibitors of Kinesin Spindle Protein
with Potent in Vivo Antitumor Activity in Lung Cancer Xenograft Models. The mitotic kinesin Eg5 is critical for the assembly of the mitotic spindle and is a promising chemotherapy target. Previously, we identified S-trityl-l-cysteine as a selective inhibitor of Eg5 and developed triphenylbutanamine analogues with improved potency, favorable drug-like properties, but moderate in vivo activity. We report here their further optimization to produce extremely potent inhibitors of Eg5 (Kiapp < 10 nM) with broad-spectrum activity against cancer cell lines comparable to the Phase II drug candidates ispinesib and SB-743921. They have good oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics and induced complete tumor regression in nude mice explanted with lung cancer patient xenografts. Furthermore, they display fewer liabilities with CYP-metabolizing enzymes and hERG compared with ispinesib and SB-743921, which is important given the likely application of Eg5 inhibitors in combination therapies. We present the case for this preclinical series to be investigated in single and combination chemotherapies, especially targeting hematological malignancies.

Introduction
Mitotic
kinesins represent an exciting class of oncology targets.1 The members of this structurally divergent superfamily
of microtubule (MT)-based molecular motor proteins have extensive
involvement throughout mitosis, with functions ranging from the organization
of the mitotic architecture to the transport of regulatory proteins.2,3 One of the most studied is the kinesin spindle protein (KSP, also
known as Eg5, Kif11, KNSL1; kinesin-5 family), whose primary role
is to establish the bipolar spindle in early prometaphase.4,5 Inhibition of Eg5 by small molecule inhibitors results in monopolar
spindles and mitotic arrest which can lead to cell death.6 This has proved highly effective across a variety
of in vitro and in vivo models of cancer, and total regression has
been demonstrated in a number of xenograft models.7-9 A great variety
of inhibitor scaffolds have been described in the literature,3,10,11 the majority of which are allosteric
inhibitors that bind to an induced fit pocket formed by loop L5, approximately
10 A from the nucleotide binding site.12 These allosteric inhibitors exhibit excellent selectivity for Eg5
among kinesins due to the unique length of loop L5 among the kinesin
superfamily.13 A number of compounds have
progressed to clinical trials, with the most advanced in phase II
(e.g., 1-3, Figure 1); however, to date the best outcome in the majority of studies
against advanced solid tumors has been limited to disease stabilization.1,11 Better responses were achieved targeting hematological malignancies
with Eg5 inhibitors.14,15 In a phase II study with the
1,3,4,-thiadiazole-based candidate ARRY-520 (3),8 a 19% objective response rate was recorded in
patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myelomas.15 Additive responses were reported on treatment with 3 and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in xenograft models
of multiple myeloma, and combination clinical trials are now planned.15,16 Targeting hematological malignancies with Eg5 inhibitors as single
agents or in combination with existing therapies therefore represents
an exciting area of investigation which may offer clinical advantages
over current regimens.

(2), and ARRY-520 (3) in clinical development.
Our group previously identified S-trityl-l-cysteine (STLC, 4) as a
tight-binding and selective
allosteric inhibitor of Eg5 (Figure 2).17-19 In common with other loop L5 Eg5 inhibitors, 4 blocks
bipolar spindle formation causing mitotic arrest, which ultimately
leads to apoptotic cell death across a variety of tumor cell lines.18 This primarily occurs through activation of
the spindle checkpoint and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.20 Antitumor activity has been reported for 4 and the p-methoxyphenyl analogue 7 across leukemia, bladder, and prostate xenograft models.21-23 In initial SAR investigations, analogues with improved cellular
potency were identified which incorporated a phenyl containing lipophilic
para substituents (e.g., 5-7, Figure 2).24-26 The subsequent elucidation of the crystal structure
of 4 in complex with Eg527,28 enabled us
to pursue the rational SAR-based optimization of this scaffold, which
led to the development of butanamine analogues with improved activity
against Eg5 (11-14, Figure 2).29 The lead triphenylbutanamine
from our previous study (11) had improved potency, favorable
drug-like properties, and in vivo antitumor activity in a lung cancer
xenograft model. We report here on the next phase of development,
which has produced analogues that significantly improve on both the
potency and in vivo efficacy of the previous leads. Across multiple
cancer cell lines, these new leads demonstrate comparable in vitro
activity to the phase II candidate ispinesib (1), and
its more potent second generation analogue SB-743921 (3) which is also undergoing clinical studies (Figure 1).1,9,30 Favorable
drug-like properties are evident across a selection of the most potent
analogues, in addition to compelling in vivo pharmacokinetics. Finally,
the new lead analogue induces complete tumor regression in a lung
cancer xenograft model. In addition to surpassing the activity of
all previously described S-trityl-l-cysteine
analogues, this in vivo efficacy is comparable with that of the drug
candidates 1-3 and strongly warrants
further development.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
S-Tritylthioethanamine and
cysteine analogues were prepared by dehydration of trityl alcohols
in trifluoroacetic acid and thioetherification with l-cysteine
or cysteamine hydrochloride (Scheme 1).31 Intermediate trityl alcohols were synthesized
by the reduction of benzophenone analogues with lithiated aryl bromides;
key thioethanamines were therefore accessible in two steps. The trityl
alcohol 59 containing a disubstituted m-ethyl,p-methylphenyl was prepared from the 5-bromobenzoic
acid derivative 55 by converting to the Weinreb amide 56 to enable controlled access to ketone 57,32 which was subsequently reduced with hydrazine
hydrate to afford the dialkyl aryl bromide 58 (Scheme 2). Subsequently, lithium bromine exchange and reduction
of benzophenone and thioetherification of 59 afforded
the target thioether 36.

Scheme 2
Triphenylbutanamine (CH2-trityl) analogues
with the
carboxylic acid were prepared by the route reported previously from
common trityl alcohol intermediates, as illustrated for rac-42 (Scheme 3).29 Allylation of trityl alcohol 60 with iron
trichloride mediating carbon-oxygen bond cleavage afforded
the carbon framework,33 prior to successive
oxidations by hydroboration-oxidation to the primary alcohol 62 and then Dess-Martin periodinane (DMP) to aldehyde 63.34 This was converted to a-aminonitrile rac-64 by a modified version of the Strecker
synthesis employing Montmorillonite KSF clay.35 Hydrolysis of rac-64 and subsequent
hydrogenation of benzylamine rac-65 using
ammonium formate gave the racemic amino acid 45.36 Attempts to resolve rac-42 by chiral HPLC using a ChiralPak IC column as described
previously were not successful.29 Triphenylbutanamines
without the carboxylic acid were prepared by functional group interconversion
from primary alcohol intermediates (e.g., 62) to the
primary amine via the mesylate and azide (Supporting
Information, Schemes S6-S8).29
Scheme 3
The b-fluorinated triphenylbutanamine rac-52 was prepared by the enamine-based organocatalyzed
a-fluorination of aldehyde 66 with l-proline
and N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide, followed by immediate
reduction37 to afford b-fluorinated
alcohol rac-67 (Scheme 4).38 Expedient access to rac-28 was then achieved by stepwise conversion
via the tosylate and azide. The b,b-difluorinated amine 53 was synthesized by a comparable methodology with SelectFluor
as the electrophilic source of fluorine.39 Direct access to azide 69 was possible from b,b-difluorinated
alcohol 68 under microwave conditions, and subsequent
reduction of 69 yielded the b,b-difluorinated-amine 53. The a-trifluoromethyl amine rac-54 was prepared from aldehyde 66 by trifluoromethylation
with TMS-CF3;40 subsequent functional
group interconversion of trifluoromethyl alcohol rac-70 via the triflate and azide gave the desired product rac-54.41

Structure-Activity
Relationship (SAR) Studies: Monosubstituted
Phenyl Rings
The most potent analogues identified previously
contained a lipophilic substituent in the meta or para position of
one phenyl ring.24,29 Crystallographic studies with p-chlorophenyl- and m-tolyl-containing
analogues 5 and 11 revealed these substituents
to be preferentially positioned in the predominantly hydrophobic environment
of the P3 pocket (Figure 3B).24,27 In the meta position, the optimal substituents were typically small
alkyl groups that were electron-donating and hydrophobic,29 which we rationalized as being due to strengthening
the C-H***p interaction between the isopropyl
side chain of Leu 214 and the phenyl ring (Figure 3A).27 A small number of thioethanamines
was prepared to determine whether this was also applicable for substituents
in the para position (15-21, Table 1). The p-methyl and p-methoxy analogues 17 and 19 demonstrated
similar basal inhibition activity, that was comparable to 16 and improved ~4-fold over 4, and while a drop
in potency was apparent upon increasing from methyl to ethyl (17 and 18), this was not seen with the ether
analogues 19-21. We evaluated all
inhibitors of Eg5 in the basal assay for growth inhibition against
K562 human leukemia cells. This cell line has previously been shown
to be susceptible to Eg5 inhibition and to overexpress Eg5.42,43 Improved activity compared with 4 was exhibited in
the cellular assay by 17, 18, and 19 containing p-alkyl and p-methoxy substituents, with 18 and 19 matching
that of the potent meta-substituted analogue 16.29 Ethoxy and triofluoromethoxy derivatives 20 and 21 proved less active, which may be due
to less appropriate physicochemical properties such as reduced aqueous
solubility (e.g., 20: turbidimetric solubility at pH
7.4 = 3.75 mM). To determine whether the optimal thioethanamine
trityl substituents were transferrable to the butanamine-based inhibitors,
several triphenylbutanamine analogues containing a single substituent
in the meta or para position were prepared (22-27, Table 1). Triphenylbutanamines 22 and 23 incorporating m-ethyl
and m-isopropyl substituents, respectively, proved
very potent in both assays, with 22 ~3-fold more
active against cells than the comparable thioether 16. The p-methoxyphenyl analogues rac-25 and 26 with and without the a-carboxylate
both displayed GI50 < 100 nM, which improved significantly
over the equivalent S-trityl pair 7 and 19. While these findings confirmed the systematically improved
activity of the butanamines versus analogous thioethanamines, in general
these new compounds exhibited equivalent in vitro activity to the
previously described leads (e.g., rac-11 and 13). The activity of the p-methoxy
analogue 26 was however improved (~2-fold) versus
other analogues without the carboxylate and now equivalent in the
cell-based assay to the zwitterionic rac-11. Interestingly, while rac-25 and 26 exhibited comparably strong activity across both assays,
the zwitterionic thioether 7 was clearly superior in
the cellular assay to 19.

(PDB ID: 4BBG) were deposited at the PDB.
Disubstituted Phenyl Rings
Having identified the optimal
substituents to improve affinity, we next investigated disubstituted
phenyl rings. By broadening the scope of our SAR data, we hoped to
utilize this knowledge to allow for more permutations to modulate
the metabolic and pharmacokinetic properties of the ultimate lead
candidates by unearthing multiple modifications capable of imbuing
Eg5 affinity. A 2,5-difluorophenyl ring in the P3 pocket produced
impressive increases in Eg5 inhibitory activity during optimization
of the clinical candidate MK-0731.44 In
our own series, although a m-fluoro substituent had
proved detrimental to Eg5 affinity,29 we
had not examined the influence of fluoro substituents in alternative
positions in combination with the optimal alkyl and methoxy substituents.
An o-fluoro substituent diminished inhibitory activity
against Eg5 substantially when combined with a methyl substituent
in either meta or para (28 and 29, Table 2). However, when combined with a p-methoxy substituent (31), the o-fluorine
produced a ~2-fold improvement in potency against Eg5 compared
with the p-methoxyphenyl 19. Retaining
the p-methoxy substituent and repositioning the fluoro
substituent in the meta position was not tolerated (32). In the cellular assay, 28, 29, 32, and 33 proved weak inhibitors, but the improvements
evident in the basal assay for 31 translated to a modest
improvement in growth inhibition compared with the p-methoxyphenyl containing 19. On introduction of the
carboxylic acid (30), a further 3-fold improvement in
growth inhibitory activity was realized compared with 7, equivalent to the butanamine lead rac-11. Interestingly the butanamine analogue of 30, compound 40 proved less potent in both the enzymatic and cellular assays.
Next, we investigated combinations of dialkyl substitutuents following
from the observation that a b-naphthyl analogue of 4 demonstrated good potency against both Eg5, in vitro and in HeLa
cells, with docking studies suggesting that the bicyclic ring occupied
the P3 pocket.24 Compounds 34-39 were prepared to investigate whether more
metabolically amenable and physiochemically favorable combinations
of dialkyl substituents could be implemented in place of the naphthyl
moiety (Table 2).45 The dialkylphenyl and tetralene analogues (35, 37, and 39) all proved comparably effective inhibitors
of Eg5 basal activity to singly substituted analogues (e.g., 16-27). When the terminal carboxylic acid
was introduced, incremental improvements in activity were apparent:
the dimethylphenyl compound 34 displayed the highest
affinity for Eg5 of any S-trityl-l-cysteine
analogue, with an estimated Kiapp [?] 1.2 nM. However, in the cell-based assay, 35, 37, and 39 lacking the carboxylate were
disappointingly weak inhibitors, with poor solubility probably the
principal cause of their reduced cellular efficacy (e.g., turbidimetric
solubility at pH 7.4: 35 = 3.75 mM, Supporting Information, Table S3). The presence
of the terminal a-carboxylic acid in the tail ameliorated this:
in addition to Kiapp < 5
nM against Eg5 in the basal assay, the l-cysteine analogues 34, 36, and 38 all exhibited improved
activity over the butanamine lead rac-11 in the cell-based assay. The most potent growth inhibition activity
was exhibited by 36 (GI50 [?] 34 nM),
which was ~30-fold better than 37 without the
a-carboxylate, highlighting the importance of achieving the
correct physicochemical balance. S-Alkylated derivatives
of cysteine were first designed as anticancer agents following the
observation that radiolabeled cysteine was incorporated by leukemic
white blood cells,46,47 so active uptake of the amino
acid zwitterion also cannot be discounted as contributing to the improved
activity of 36 compared with 37. Next, we
transferred the optimal dialkyl substituent pattern to the butanamine
scaffold. The poor aqueous solubility of tetralene 38 even when the carboxylic acid was present precluded continuing with
this modification (turbidimetric solubility at pH 7.4 = 20 mM).
Although 36 was more potent in the cellular assay, the
superior Eg5 affinity and physicochemical properties of the dimethylphenyl
analogue 34 marked this as the optimal modification from
this selection. The prepared compound rac-42 was less potent in the basal assay but importantly proved 3-fold
more active in the cellular growth inhibition assay (GI50 [?] 23 nM), thereby improving on the activity of both the previously
reported butanamine leads 11 and 12 (Figure 2)29 and the l-cysteine analogues 34, 36, and 38 in this assay.
Analogues with Modifications on Two Phenyl
Rings
All
the modifications to the trityl group described so far increased its
hydrophobicity, which in certain cases compromised cellular efficacy
due to poor aqueous solubility (e.g., 38). In addition
to this immediately apparent penalty, excessively lipophilic (i.e.,
log P/log D7.4 > 3)
compounds
are more likely to possess unfavorable ADME properties and bind more
promiscuously, which is likely to result in greater side effects and
general toxicity.48 We were interested
in developing hydrophilic modifications to the trityl group to produce
a more physicochemically balanced scaffold to serve as a backup to
the lead amino acid-based compounds. One way to achieve this was by
replacing a phenyl ring with a heterocycle; however, none of the investigated
analogues displayed noteworthy activity (S1-S5, Supporting Information, Table S1), in
agreement with other reports on thiophene and pyridyl analogues.26,49 Previously we identified certain hydrophilic phenyl substituents
that reduced the lipophilicity of the trityl headgroup and improved
cellular efficacy (e.g., 8 and 9, Figure 2).29 The most effective
of these modifications was the m-hydroxy 8, designed to form hydrogen-bonding interactions with the peptide
backbone of the P2 pocket (Figure 3A).12,29 Modest improvements in cellular efficacy were also noted in analogues
containing primary and secondary amide phenyl substituents (e.g., 9, Figure 2). These amides were proposed
to occupy the solvent-exposed P1 region because of the steric restrictions
in the P2 pocket observed in other SAR studies (Figure 3B).44,50,51 We combined each of these modifications in turn, with a lipophilic
substituent on a different phenyl in the trityl group, to investigate
if synergistic increments in activity could be achieved (44-51, Table 3). While no
improvement was apparent for thioethanamine rac-45 containing a m-phenol and m-chlorophenyl, the related m-phenol analogues rac-46 and rac-47 with m-ethyl- and p-methylphenyl
substituents were 5-fold and 4-fold more potent inhibitors of Eg5
basal activity, respectively, than comparable analogues 16 and 17. These analogues also exhibited improved inhibition
over their respective benchmarks in the K562 assay: e.g., rac-46 improved >=2-fold over the benchmarks 8 and 16, and rac-47 improved >=5-fold over 8 and 17.
These data implied a synergistic binding motif was being realized,
with hydrogen bonding interactions from the m-hydroxyl
in the P2 pocket augmented by hydrophobic interactions with the alkyl-substituted
phenyl rings situated in the P3 pocket. While no increase in potency
was evident in the basal assay when a p-tolyl was
combined with a m-(primary amide)-containing phenyl,
this combination afforded a ~2-fold improvement in the cellular
assay (rac-49 compared with 9 and 17) which also supported the proposed binding conformation.
With GI50 [?] 100 nM, rac-47 is the most active thioethanamine without the terminal a-carboxylic
acid in the cellular assay reported to date and comparable to the
lead butanamine 11. These modifications did not prove
advantageous when applied in the comparable butanamine rac-51, which was less active in both assays than rac-47 or 11. Better activity
was evident on addition of the terminal carboxylate in the basal assay
but not in the cellular assay (dia-50). We previously noted that passive cellular diffusion was adversely
affected by the presence of both the a-carboxylate in the tail
and amide or hydroxyl phenyl substituents, which may offer a partial
explanation for the comparatively weak cellular activity of the zwitterionic
butanamine dia-50.
Crystal Structure of the Eg5-46 Complex
The binding mode proposed for analogues with two orthogonal phenyl
substituents was confirmed when the crystal structure of 46 in complex with Eg5 was solved to a resolution of 2.65 A. This
showed the m-phenol in P2 and the m-ethyl in P3 (Figure 3C). Data collection and
refinement statistics are presented in Table 4. The Eg5-46 complex crystallized in space group I213 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Although
the racemic mixture of 46 was used for crystallization,
only the R-enantiomer was observed in the inhibitor-binding
pocket. The three phenyl rings of (R)-46 are positioned in the same overall conformation as 4, and consequently the hydrophobic and aromatic interactions between
the three phenyl rings and the residues in the inhibitor-binding pocket
are conserved.27,28 In the thioethanamine tail, the
primary amine maintains the crucial hydrogen bonds exhibited by all
analogues of 4 with the carboxylate of Glu116 and the
main chain amide carbonyl of Gly117.26,27,29 The well-defined electron density affords accurate
positioning of the two phenyl substituents and provides a clear structural
rationale for the improvements exhibited in binding affinity. The m-ethylphenyl is situated in the predominantly hydrophobic
P3 pocket bounded by Leu160, Gly217, Ala218, Arg221, mimicking the m-tolyl and p-chlorophenyl rings in previous
crystal structures.26,29 However, the terminal CH3 of the ethyl extends into previously unutilized space between
the methyl of Ala218 and the aliphatic chain of Arg221. The m-phenol of 46 occupies the P2 pocket formed
by Glu118, Arg119, Trp127, Asp130, Leu132, Ala133, and Pro137, with
the hydroxyl pointing toward the core of the protein instead of outward
toward the solvent. Hydrogen-bonding interactions are evident in this
position from the hydroxyl to the main chain carbonyl of Glu118, the
main chain nitrogen of Ala133 and additional weak electrostatic interactions
with the main chain nitrogen of Arg119, one of the side chain oxygens
of Asp130, and the carbonyl oxygen of Leu132 (distance cutoff = 4.0
A), similar to those observed in the Eg5-monastrol complex
and structurally related dihydropyrimidines, thereby stabilizing the
inhibitor in the allosteric site and increasing the affinity for the
protein.12,52
Inhibition of MT-Stimulated ATPase Activity and Kinesin Selectivity
The inhibitory activity of the most potent analogues from the initial
in vitro assays was next examined in a MT-stimulated Eg5 ATPase assay,
together with selected control compounds (4, 7, rac-11, and 13) and
external benchmarks (1 and 2, Table 5). In cells, Eg5 uses MT filaments as tracks to
push antiparallel MTs apart, which makes this particular assay closer
to physiological conditions. Three new analogues (36, rac-42, and rac-47) possessed Kiapp estimates of <10 nM. Recently, the inhibitory activity of monastrol
against Eg5 was shown to be dependent on the ionic strength of the
buffer.65 To investigate whether this was
the case for our scaffold, we assessed MT-stimulated ATPase activity
of compounds 1 and rac-42 at different salt concentrations. For both compounds, the IC50 values systematically decrease with increasing salt concentrations,
indicating that activity is optimal under the more physiologically
relevant conditions represented by 150 mM NaCl (Supporting Information, Figure S2).
Analogues 4, 7, and 11 were
all previously tested against multiple kinesins and found to specifically
inhibit Eg5. Against a panel of seven human kinesins containing Kif3B
(kinesin-2; organelle transport), neuron-specific Kif5A and Kif5B/conventional
kinesin (both kinesin-1; cargo transport), Kif7 (kinesin-4, involved
in Hedgehog signaling), Kif9 (kinesin-9; regulation of matrix degradation),
and Kif20A/MKLP-2 and Kif20B/MPP1 (both kinesin-6; required for cytokinesis),2,3rac-42 displayed no activity at a
maximum inhibitor concentration of 200 mM (Supporting Information, Table S4 and Figure S1), which confirms
the proposed high selectivity of this class of inhibitors within the
kinesin superfamily.17,18,25,29 Our analogues have not yet been tested on
ATPases beyond the kinesins, although other S-trityl-l-cysteine analogues were recently shown to be weak inhibitors
of hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase.53
Evaluation of Inhibitors across Multiple Cell Lines
A selection
of the new lead compounds was evaluated in five additional
cell lines derived from colon (HCT116), pancreas (BxPC-3), prostate
(LNCaP and PC3), and lung (NCI-H1299) tumors, to determine in vitro
efficacy against a histologically broader panel of cancer cell lines
(Table 5). The lead compounds from our previous
study with and without the carboxylic acid (11 and 13, respectively) were included to assess progress,29 along with the original hit 4 and
the phase II drug candidates 1 and 2. In
general, HCT116 cells were the most responsive to the Eg5 inhibitors
tested, whereas NCI-H1299 cells were the least affected. Three of
the new analogues (34, 36, and rac-42) displayed activity higher than that of the original
lead (rac-11);29 additionally both 36 and rac-42 were more potent than the clinical candidate 1 and equal to its more potent second generation analogue 2. For those compounds without the carboxylic acid group, three (26, rac-47, rac-51) were more active than the previous lead 13 but less active than rac-11. We have
shown previously that for 4, 11, and 12, the absolute configuration of the stereocenter in the
amino acid tail has very little effect on efficacy.18,29 The phenol compounds rac-47 and rac-51 were prepared racemically and contain
a stereocenter at the trityl carbon more likely to affect activity,
especially given that only the (R)-enantiomer was
observed in the crystal structure of the Eg5-46 complex. Compounds prepared via the TFA-mediated dehydration of
chiral tertiary alcohols form a 1:1 ratio of enantiomers (Scheme 1).49 However, we did
not investigate the resolution of rac-47 and rac-51 further, as rac-47 displayed very high clearance in human hepatocytes
(Clint = 50.1 +- 4.2 mL min-1; t1/2 = 27.7 min) and thus was not suitable
for progression as a drug candidate.
Profiling of Druglike Properties
of Lead Compounds
We subsequently subjected the new lead
compounds from this study
(34, 36, and rac-42) to a series of in vitro and in vivo physicochemical and
ADMET assays to evaluate if in addition to pharmacodynamics improvements,
they exhibited favorable drug-like properties (Table 6). The phase II candidate 2 was included as an
external benchmark; the profile for the first generation candidate 1 has been reported previously.29 The p-methoxy analogue 7 was also
profiled, as this compound was reported to inhibit the rate of tumor
growth in subcutaneous prostate (PC3Luc cells) and bladder
xenograft tumor models.22,23 Analogue 7 has a balanced profile, with favorable physiochemical characteristics
and reasonable metabolic stability in both human microsomes and hepatocytes.
Moderate affinity is displayed for the 2C19 CYP isoform. In comparison
to the other lead compounds, 7 is systematically less
potent in vitro (Table 5), and so was not investigated
further. The most potent analogue lacking the carboxylic acid 26, which also contains a p-methoxyphenyl,
was profiled and interestingly proved metabolically more resilient
in human microsomal and hepatocyte assays than 7. Several
liabilities were however evident, including low turbidimetric solubility
at physiological pH (>30 mM), hERG inhibition, and moderate
to significant inhibition of CYP isoforms from four of the main families.54 This agreed with the trend previously observed
that compounds lacking the carboxylic acid group have generally more
liabilities than those possessing it.29 At this stage, we investigated whether modulating the basicity of
the primary amine would be an effective strategy to ameliorate these.29 Although alkylation of primary amines can overcome
hERG inhibition,55 the hydrogen bonds formed
by the primary amine in 4 are crucial to maintaining
activity (Figure 3A), with secondary amines
only weakly active.26,27 We therefore applied the subtler
strategy of modulating the pKa by b-fluorination
to produce 52-54 (Table 7).56 In the basal assay,
while inhibitory activity comparable to that of the unmodified 26 was displayed by b-fluorinated rac-52, the binding affinity was substantially reduced
for b,b-difluorinated 53 and lowered to micromolar
levels for a-trifluoromethyl-containing rac-54. Despite good potency against Eg5, in cells rac-52 proved ~8-fold less active than
the unmodified 26, and 53 only exhibited
micromolar levels of growth inhibition. While these results reinforce
the importance of the protonated state of the primary amine at physiological
pH, the reasonable basal activity suggests that multiple factors contributed
to the reduced cellular efficacy. As this strategy did not appear
useful in this series, we did not investigate further.
Consequently, we profiled
our two most potent cysteine-based analogues, 34 and 36, which differ only by an extra methylene
in the meta position that imparts 3- to 4-fold higher potency across
cellular assays (Table 5). This gain in potency
comes at a cost: 36 exhibits higher clearance in human
hepatocytes (24.4 +- 4.7 versus 7.9 +- 3.4 mL/min/million
cells) and is less available in human plasma (1.55% versus 4.51%,
Table 6). A distinct profile is also evident
toward CYP enzymes: like the p-methoxy analogue 7, 34 inhibits CYP 2C19 (IC50 = 7.9
+- 1.3 mM), whereas 36 does not but instead
weakly inhibits CYP 2C9 (IC50 = 14.0 +- 4.9 mM).
Compound 36 displays high bioavailability (63%) when
compared to that determined previously for 1 (45%), 13 (4%), and rac-11 (51%) (Table 8).29 The pharmacokinetic
data is in good agreement with that from the in vitro mouse metabolic
profiling: 36 has a shorter half-life and higher clearance
than the clinical candidate 1, with rac-11 displaying low clearance in comparison.29
The butanamine
analogue of 34 and most active from
the in vitro profiling, rac-42, was
investigated next. Direct comparison with 34 illustrates
that rac-42 displays higher turbidimetric
solubility (>100 mM versus 65 mM), increased metabolic
resilience in human hepatocytes (5.9 +- 1.9 versus 7.9 +-
3.4 mL/min/million cells) and does not inhibit any of the common
CYP isoforms examined. In common with the profiled zwitterionic S-trityl analogues, no affinity is evident toward the hERG
channel. This attractive profile is analogous to that reported for
our previous lead, rac-11.29
Examining clinical candidate 2 in the same assays,
we observed improved solubility at the three pHs tested compared to 1 (>100 mM versus 65 mM).29 The reduced log P of 2 also
translates
to a higher proportion of unbound compound in human plasma (22% versus
8%). However, 2 retains the potentially physiologically
significant hERG channel interactions and affinity for the CYP isoform
3A4 evident for 1.29 Therefore,
the butanamines rac-11 and rac-42 possess a more balanced ADMET profile, which may
offer distinct clinical advantages.
In Vivo Xenograft Studies
We advanced the three most
active and balanced of the new analogues (34, 36, and rac-42) into in vivo xenograft
experiments with lung cancer patient explants (LXFS 538) passaged
as subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. As controls, our previous
lead analogue rac-11 and the clinical
candidate 1 were selected. We adopted lung cancer xenograft
models, as this is a key area for improving therapy due to the poor
prognosis for most patients;57 the indications
that Eg5 inhibitors may achieve better clinical outcomes in hematological
malignancies rather than in solid tumors came after this work had
commenced. We used explanted tumors, as these are a more realistic
model than solid tumors derived from in vitro cell lines. The transplanted
tumors retain the histological complexity from the patient, reflect
prior treatment and have been shown to be better predictors of clinical
response.58,59 Administering our previous lead, rac-11, by an improved dosing schedule resulted
in complete tumor regression at day 44 (Figure 4A), in comparison to partial remission recorded previously.29 When treatment stopped, tumor growth relapsed
around day 76 (data not shown). Xenograft experiments for 1 have previously been reported at a dose of 8-10 mg/kg in
breast tumor models.60 In mice implanted
with LXFS 538 tumors, treatment at this dose proved to be lethal (data
not shown), and similar toxicity issues have been observed previously.7 When we repeated at a lower dose of 6 mg/kg,
total tumor regression was evident around day 13 and the mice remained
tumor free over the entire observation time (Figure 4A). For the cysteine containing 36, although
significantly more potent than rac-11 in cell-based assays, only a reduced tumor growth rate was observed
(Figure 4B), although the difference was still
statistically significant (p = 0.0124). No tumor
growth inhibition was evident for 34 (Figure 4C). Metabolic profiling of 34 and 36 explained this poor in vivo activity compared to the strong
in vitro efficacy: although stable in mouse microsomes, 36 showed high clearance in mouse hepatocytes (58.7 +- 5.64 mL/min/million
cells; t1/2 = 23.6 min). A similar explanation
applied for 34: while stable in human microsomes with
only low clearance in human hepatocytes (7.9 +- 3.4 mL/min/million
cells), medium clearance was evident in mouse microsomes (17.8 +-
3.7 mL/min/mg protein) and extremely high clearance by mouse
hepatocytes (170 +- 9.4 mL/min/million cells; t1/2 = 8.2 min). Therefore, nude mice xenografts are not
an appropriate model for assessing the therapeutic potential of 34 and 36: in the future, alternative models
such as nude rats will need to be employed, if these compounds prove
metabolically more stable in rat hepatocytes. In contrast to the thioethanamines 34 and 36, the activity of the most potent butanamine rac-42 was translated effectively into the
xenograft model, with total tumor regression by day 17, improving
on the activity recorded for rac-11 and
comparable to the response achieved on treatment with 1 (Figure 4C).

(p = 0.0003).

Conclusions
Optimization of 4 has led
to structurally relatively
simple yet extremely effective Eg5 inhibitors which display in vitro
and in vivo antitumor activity comparable to benchmark inhibitors
further advanced in clinical trials. The only other Eg5 inhibitors
reported to induce complete tumor regression in mice xenograft models,
to the best of our knowledge, are the three clinical candidates 1-3 in phase II.7-9 We propose that
the favorable drug-like properties, as highlighted by in vitro profiling,
strengthens the case for the progression of triphenylbutanamine analogues
based on rac-42 for further evaluation.
In general, the butanamines proved systematically more potent than
the equivalent thioethanamines, but most notably their increased metabolic
stability imparted improved efficacy in xenograft studies with nude
mice. Both the profiled butanamine and thioethanamine leads rac-11 and 36 show
good oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics; however, for an accurate
assessment of the potential of these S-trityl analogues,
alternative in vivo models will need to be examined. In this and our
preceding study, we have developed a range of modifications to the
core scaffold which impart excellent affinity for the target protein
Eg5. The potential of clinical candidates based on rac-42 will be determined by selecting those which provide
optimal bioavailability and robust pharmacokinetics, a process we
have initiated through the profiling described here. The wider challenge
facing Eg5 inhibitors is translating the efficacy evident in preclinical
studies into the clinic. The responses to Eg5 inhibitors in clinical
trials have been limited to date, and one explanation for this is
that tumor doubling times in xenograft models are significantly faster
than those in human patients and thus not sufficiently realistic models
for developing chemotherapeutics.61 This
hypothesis is corroborated by the improved responses observed against
faster growing hematological cancers and the principal dose-limiting
toxicities for most clinical candidates of neutropenia and myelosuppression.1 Early clinical indications suggest a possible
application for Eg5 inhibitors in advanced multiple myeloma, which
will most likely be in combination with existing therapies.15 In combined chemotherapies, the potential for
inducing drug-drug interactions and toxicities becomes increasingly
important. For example, the hepatic metabolism of the synthetic glucocorticoid
dexamethasone currently used in the treatment of multiple myeloma
is mediated primarily by CYP 3A4.62 Both
of the trial Eg5 drugs we profiled, 1 and 2, are CYP 3A4 inhibitors, so careful consideration of the physiological
relevance of these interactions would be required prior to undertaking
combination-based therapy. Limited information is available on the
relevant properties of other candidates under investigation.1 We have demonstrated that in comparison to the
clinical candidates 1 and 2, the lead S-trityl-l-cysteine-derived analogues rac-11 and rac-42 exhibit
comparable in vivo efficacy by inducing complete tumor regression
in an advanced tumor explant xenograft model but display fewer liabilities
toward CYP enzymes and the hERG channel. Furthermore, unlike other
highly advanced Eg5 inhibitors, the described compounds are not patented
and therefore are freely available for investigation in single or
combined cancer chemotherapies by the scientific and medical community,
which we propose, based on the recent results for ARRY-520, should
focus on targeting hematological malignancies.

Chemistry
General
Compounds 4 and 2 were purchased from Nova Biochem, Sigma Aldrich,
and Selleck Chemicals,
respectively, and used without further purification. Compound 1 was a gift from Sanofi-Aventis. Compounds 8, 9, 11-16, and 43 were prepared as reported previously.29 Compound 7 (NSC123528) was obtained from the
NCI/DTP Open Chemical Repository (http://dtp.cancer.gov) of the National Cancer Institute. All reagents and solvents were
of commercial quality and used without further purification. Anhydrous
reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a nitrogen
atmosphere unless otherwise noted. Microwave reactions were performed
using a Biotage Initiator-8 microwave synthesizer (operating at 2.45
GHz). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on aluminum-backed
SiO2 plates (silica gel 60, F254), and spots
were visualized using ultraviolet light (254 nm) or by staining with
phosphomolybdic acid (alcohols) or ninhydrin (amines). Flash column
chromatography was performed on silica gel (SNAP KP-Sil, 60 A,
40-63 mm cartridges) using a Biotage SP4 automated chromatography
system (detection wavelength, 254 nm; monitoring, 280 nm). Melting
points were determined using a Stuart Scientific SMP1 melting point
apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECX-400 (400 MHz), Avance DPX400 (400
MHz), or Avance DPX500 (500 MHz) spectrometer. 19F NMR
spectra were recorded on an Avance AV400 (400 MHz) instrument equipped
with a multinuclear probe. 1H chemical shifts (d)
are reported in ppm relative to the residual signal of the deuterated
solvent (7.26 in CDCl3, 3.31 in CD3OD, and 2.50
in DMSO-d6). Multiplicities are indicated
by s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (unresolved
multiplet), and br (broad signal). 13C chemical shifts
(d) are reported in ppm relative to the carbon resonance of
the deuterated solvent (77.16 in CDCl3, 49.00 in CD3OD, and 39.52 in DMSO-d6). 19F spectra are referenced relative to CFCl3. High-resolution

7890A GC system and an Agilent 5975C Inert XL EI/CI MSD with a DSQ2
single quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with an Agilent Technologies
DB5-MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm). Helium was
the carrier gas (flow rate = 1 mL/min-1). Elemental
analysis data were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 series 2 CHN analyzer.
LC-MS analyzes were performed with an Agilent Quaternary 1200 series
pump and an Agilent 6130 dual source mass spectrometer with UV detection
at 254 nM. Retention times (tR) were in
minutes, and purity was calculated as percentage of total area. The
method for determining purity consisted of the following: Zorbax Eclipse
XDB-C18 reverse phase column (15 cm x 4.3 mm, particle
size 5 mm); column temperature 40 degC; solvent A: H2O (5 mM ammonium acetate); solvent B: MeCN (5 mM ammonium

Biology
Inhibition of Basal and MT-Stimulated Eg5 ATPase Activities
The inhibition of the basal and MT-stimulated ATPase activities
was measured as previously described using a TECAN Sunrise photometer.29 The experiments were performed at 25 degC.
In short, the inhibition of the basal ATPase activity was measured
at a concentration of 80-100 nM Eg5 in the presence of 150
mM NaCl. The inhibition of the MT-stimulated ATPase activity was determined
at an Eg5 concentration of ~5 nM in the presence of 150 mM
NaCl. For this Eg5 construct, it has been noted that the Kiapp estimates are dependent on the salt concentration
of the buffer.65S-Trityl-l-cysteine and related inhibitors are tight-binding inhibitors;18 estimates for Kiapp values were therefore calculated using the Morrison
equation.66
Calculation of Ligand Efficiencies
Ligand efficiencies
(LE) were calculated from the equation: LE = -DG/HAC [?] -RT ln(Kiapp)/HAC, where DG is
the change in Gibbs free energy, T is the absolute
temperature, R represents the gas constant, and HAC
is the heavy atom count for non-hydrogen atoms.67 Ligand efficiencies were calculated in Pipeline Pilot 7.4
for Windows (Accelerys Software, San Diego, CA).
Tissue Culture
HCT116 (ATCC CCL-247) cells were cultured
in DMEM (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (PAA, Pasching, Austria). K562 (ATCC CCL-243), LNCaP (ATCC CRL-1740),
PC-3 (ATCC CRL-1435), and NCI-H1299 (CRL-5803) cells were cultured
in RPMI (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (PAA, Pasching, Austria). BxPC-3 (ATCC CRL-1687) cells were
cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.), supplemented with 1%
nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.), 1% sodium pyruvate
(Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.), 1% glutamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.),
and 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA, Pasching, Austria). Cells were maintained
at 37 degC, 95% humidity, and 5% carbon dioxide in a humidified
incubator and used for experiments for 6-8 weeks before being
replaced with fresh stocks that had been stored in liquid nitrogen.
Proliferation Assays
Cells were seeded in triplicate
in 96-well assay plates at 1.250 cells (BxPC-3, HCT116), 1.500 cells
(PC-3), 2.500 cells (NCI-H1299), 3.000 cells (LNCaP), or 5.000 cells
(K562) per well in 100 mL of the respective growth medium. Medium
blanks and cell blanks were also prepared for every cell line. On
the next day, inhibitors were added with a starting concentration
of 100 mM in a 3-fold serial dilution series. At 72 h after
addition of inhibitors, 10% Alamar blue (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.)
was added, and depending on the cell line, between 2 and 12 h later
the absorbance was measured at 570 and 600 nm. All values were corrected
for the absorbance of the medium blank, and the corrected cell blanks
were set to 100%. Calculations for determining the relative proliferation
were performed using the equations described in the manufacturer's
manual. The GI50 values were subsequently determined using
a sigmoidal dose-response fitting (variable slope) with GraphPad
Prism 5.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
Drug
Profiling of Compounds
Profiling of drug-like
properties of interesting compounds including physicochemical properties
(turbidimetric solubility, permeability), metabolism and safety (human
and mouse microsomal and hepatocyte stability, plasma protein binding,
cytochrome P450 inhibition, hERG), and pharmacokinetics were determined
at Cyprotex, as previously described.29
Tumor Xenografts
The animal experiments were performed
at Oncotest GmbH with female NMRI nu/nu mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld,
Germany). Tumor fragments were obtained from xenografts in serial
passage in nude mice. Mice were randomized to the various groups,
and dosing was started when the required number of mice carried a
tumor of 50-250 mm3 volume, preferably 80-200
mm3. Vehicle for 1: 10% ethanol, 10% cremophor,
80% D5W (dextrose 5%); vehicle for all other compounds: 8% DMSO, 2%
Tween 80, distilled water (pH 5). All treatments were given intraperitoneally.
Vehicle control mice (group 1) were treated with 10 mL/kg vehicle
on days 0, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 20, 22, 24, 29, 31, 34, 36, 38, 48, 51,
55, 58, 62, 65, and 69.
The rac-11 treatment group (group 2) received 20 mg/kg rac-11 on day 0; 14 mg/kg rac-11 on day 3;
18 mg/kg rac-11 on days 6 and 8; 14
mg/kg rac-11 on days 10 and 13; 16 mg/kg rac-11 on day 20; 18 mg/kg rac-11 on days 22, 24, 29, and 31; 20 mg/kg rac-11 on day 34; 16 mg/kg rac-11 on days 36 and 38; 20 mg/kg rac-11 on days 48, 51, 55, and 62; and 22.5 mg/kg rac-11 on days 65, 69, and 80. The treatment group for 1 (group 3) received 10 mg/kg of 1 on days 0 and 4, and
6 mg/kg of 1 on days 7, 20, and 24.
Vehicle control
mice (group 1) were treated with 10 mL/kg vehicle
on days 2, 4, 7, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, and 32. The 36 treatment group (group 2) received 15 mg/kg 36 on days 0, 2, 4; 17 mg/kg 36 on day 7; 14 mg/kg 36 on days 11, 14, and 16; 17 mg/kg 36 on days
18, 21, and 23; 20 mg/kg 36 on days 25 and 28; and 22.5
mg/kg 36 on days 30 and 32.
Vehicle control mice
(group 1) were treated with 10 mL/kg vehicle
on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14. The rac-42 treatment group (group 2) received 15 mg/kg rac-42 on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14. The 34 treatment group (group 3) received 15 mg/kg 34 on days
0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 and up to 30 mg/kg during later treatment, without
indications of toxicity at this dose.
Mortality checks were
conducted at least daily during routine monitoring.
Body weight was used as a means of determining toxicity. Mice were
weighed twice a week. The tumor volume was determined by two-dimensional
measurement with a caliper on the day of randomization (day 0) and
then twice weekly (i.e., on the same days on which mice were weighed).
Tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula (ab2) x 0.5 where a represents the
largest and b the perpendicular tumor diameter. Tumor
inhibition for a particular day (T/C in %) was calculated from the ratio of the median RTV (relative
tumor volumes) values of test versus control groups multiplied by
100%. For the evaluation of the statistical significance of tumor
inhibition, the Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. Individual
RTVs were compared on days on which the minimum T/C was achieved, as long as sufficient animals were
left for statistical analysis or otherwise on days as indicated. By
convention, p <= 0.05 indicates significance
of tumor inhibition. Statistical calculations were performed using
GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
Crystallization
of the Eg5-46 Complex
Purified Eg5 (20
mg/mL) in complex with 1 mM Mg2+ATP
was incubated with 2 mM rac-46 (in DMSO)
for 2 h on ice. Crystals of Eg5 with 46 appeared after
1 week in hanging drops by mixing 1 mL of protein-inhibitor
complex with 1 mL of reservoir solution containing 22% PEG-3350,
0.3 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES pH 5.5, and 0.01 M trimethylamine
hydrochloride in VDX plates (Hampton Research) at 4 degC. Dehydrating
solution (32% PEG-3350, 0.36 M of ammonium sulfate, 0.12 M MES pH
5.5, 0.012 M trimethylamine hydrochloride, and 10% glycerol) was added
slowly to the crystal droplet until the total volume of the drop was
eight times the original. The drop was then equilibrated against air
in 4 degC for 30 min. A cubic crystal with dimensions of approximately
0.1 mm on each side was then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data
Collection and Processing
Diffraction data for
the Eg5-inhibitor complexes Eg5-46 were
recorded at the ESRF ID23-2. Data were processed using iMosflm68 and scaled using Scala69 from the CCP4 suite of programs.70 The
calculation of Rfree used 5% of data.
The Eg5-46 structure was solved by molecular replacement
(Phaser)71 using one molecule of Eg5 motor
domain from 3KEN.28 Refinement was carried
out with PHENIX.72 Electron-density and
difference density maps, all sA-weighted, were inspected,
and the model was improved using Coot.73 Model geometry was analyzed using MolProbity.74 For the Eg5-46 complex, 97.0% (322)
of the residues are in the preferred regions, 2.7% (9) are in the
allowed regions, and 0.3% (1) are outliers. Figures were prepared
using PyMOL.75
