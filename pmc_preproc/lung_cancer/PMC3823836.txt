[Abstract, Methods, Mixed]

Oncogenic and drug sensitive NTRK1 rearrangements in lung cancer. We identified novel gene fusions in patients with lung cancer harboring the kinase domain of the NTRK1 gene that encodes the TRKA receptor. Both the MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1 fusions lead to constitutive TRKA kinase activity and are oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth. Three of 91 lung cancer patients (3.3%), without known oncogenic alterations, assayed by NGS or FISH demonstrated evidence of NTRK1 gene fusions.

Online Methods
Patients
Colorado Multiple Institution Review Board (IRB) or the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IRB approval was obtained for all patients in this study. FoundationOne testing and FISH analyses were performed in CLIA-certified laboratories. The index patient who underwent treatment with crizotinib consented to treatment outside of a clinical trial.
Next Generation DNA Sequencing
DNA was extracted from 40 mm of FFPE or frozen tissue using the Maxwell 16 FFPE Plus LEV DNA Purification kit (Promega) and quantified using the PicoGreen fluorescence assay (Invitrogen). Library Construction was performed as previously described using 50-200ng of DNA sheared by sonication to ~100-400bp prior to end-repair, dA addition and ligation of indexed, Illumina sequencing adaptors.25 Enrichment of target sequences (3,320 exons of 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns from 14 genes recurrently rearranged in cancer representing ~1.1 Mb of the human genome) was achieved by solution-based hybrid capture with a custom Agilent SureSelect biotinylated RNA baitset.25 The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using 49x49 paired-end reads. Sequence data from genomic DNA was mapped to the reference human genome (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and were processed using the publicly available SAMtools, Picard, and Genome Analysis Toolkit.26,27 Genomic rearrangements were detected by clustering chimeric reads mapped to targeted introns.
RNA extraction from FFPE and Frozen tissues
RNA was isolated from FFPE or frozen tumor samples as described previously.3 Briefly, FFPE samples were processed using the RecoverAll(tm) Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion) following deparaffinization in xylene and washed with 100% ethanol prior to Protease K digest. Extraction of RNA from frozen tissue was accomplished using TriReagent (Ambion). Alternatively, tumors from NSCLC patients obtained at surgery were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in OCT and sectioned. RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (Qiagen).
RT-PCR and Sequencing of MPRIP- and CD74-NTRK1
RT-PCR of MPRIP-NTRK1 was carried out using the SuperScript(r) III First-Strand Synthesis System (SSIII RT) from Invitrogen with a NTRK1 primer located in exon 15 ('NTRK1 Y490R1') for reverse transcription by PCR using the same reverse primer, 'NTRK1 Y490R1', and a primer to MPRIP located in its 3rd coil-coiled domain ('MPRIP CC3F1'). PCR products were resolved on an agarose gel and the fragments were excised and treated with ExoSapIT (Affymetrix) prior to sequencing by the University of Colorado Cancer Center DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit version 1.1 (Applied Biosystems) using the same forward and reverse primer in the RT-PCR reaction. For CD74-NTRK1, reverse transcription was carried out using the QuanTitec Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). PCR of the resulting cDNA was performed using the primers 'CD74 Exon 3 FOR' and 'NTRK1 Exon 15 REV'. Primers used for RT-PCR and sequencing are available in Supplementary Table 4. The reference sequences used for exon alignment are NCBI Reference Sequences: NM_002529.3 (NTRK1), NM_015134.3 (MPRIP), and NM_001025159.2 (CD74).
Cloning full length MPRIP-, CD74-, and TPM3-NTRK1
cDNA was generated from the patient using the SSIII RT kit describe above along with a primer located at the end of NTRK1 (NTRK1stopR2). This cDNA was used to amplify two separate overlapping fragments that were used to generate full length MPRIP-NTRK1 by overlap extension PCR using the two fragments alone for 10 cycles and then adding the MPRIPStart and NTRK1stopR1 primers for an additional 30 cycles of PCR amplification. The resulting 4kb PCR product was gel isolated and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A 3' hemagglutinin (HA) tag was added to MPRIP-NTRK1 using PCR amplification with primers harboring the HA encoding sequence.. The amplified product was subsequently cloned into the pCDH-CMV-MSC1-EF1-Puro lentiviral plasmid (System Biosciences). Full length TPM3-NTRK1 was amplified from KM12 cDNA using TPM3Start RI and NTRKStopNotI primers and cloned into the lentiviral plasmid as described above. The NCBI Reference Sequence used for TPM3 is NM_153649.3. For the CD74-NTRK1 construct, cDNA was transcribed with Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen). Full length CD74-NTRK1 was amplified using the primers 'CD74 FOR' and 'NTRK1 REV' using AccuPrime(tm) Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and cloned into the pDNR-Dual vector (BD Biosciences) and recombined into JP1520 retroviral vector as previously described.28 The full-length cDNA of each gene was confirmed by sequencing. Primers used for cloning are available in Supplementary Table 4.
Quantitative PCR of NTRK1
Relative Quantification Polymerase Chain Reaction (RQ-PCR) assay of the NTRK1 tyrosine-kinase domain (Hs01021011_m1; Applied Biosystems) was used to evaluate its level of mRNA expression. The relative quantification method (DDCT) in the StepOnePlus Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) was used with GUSB (Applied Biosystems) as an endogenous control. All samples were evaluated in triplicate.
RNA Sequencing
Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed as previously described.29 RNA FASTQ files were aligned and splice junctions mapped using TopHat30 and analyzed for fusion reads using the Broad Institute Cancer Genome Analysis Tools Suite (www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga) and (www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/RNA-seq/).

Total TRKA (C-14), GAPDH, and a-tubulin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc.
Lentivirus or retrovirus production and cell transduction
MPRIP-NTRK1 or the kinase dead variant was introduced into cells via lentivirus as previously described.31 NIH3T3 cells transduced with lentivirus were cultured in DMEM medium with 5% calf serum and 0.75 mg/ml puromycin. Ba/F3 cells transduced with lentivirus were cultured as above with 2 mg/ml puromycin, and with or without 1 ng/ml IL-3 (R&D Systems). Alternatively, CD74-NTRK1 was introduced into cells using retrovirus as previously described.28 Polyclonal cell lines were established by puromycin selection. Cell proliferation and growth were performed as previously described.28,36
Mouse Xenograft Studies
NIH3T3 cells (106) harboring the indicated expression vectors were resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice (kind gift of James DeGregori). Mice were monitored three times weekly for tumor formation and sacrificed when tumors reached approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. Approval for the use of animals in this study was granted by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed as previously described.31 Briefly, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo-Scientific) and diluted in loading buffer (LI-COR Biosciences). Membranes were scanned and analyzed using the Odyssey Imaging System and software (LI-COR). Alternatively, immunoblotting was performed according to the antibody manufacturer's recommendations using chemiluminescent detection (Perkin Elmer). All western blot images are representative of at least 3 independent experiments.
Proliferation assays
All assays were performed as previously described by seeding 1000 cells/well, drug treatments were performed 24 hours after seeding, and Cell Titer 96 MTS (Promega) was added 72 hours later or as described previously.28,31,36 IL-3 was removed from Ba/F3 cells 48 hours prior to seeding.
Soft agar assays
Anchorage-independent growth was measured by seeding 100,000 cells per well of soft agar in 6 well plates as previously described.31 Media was changed every 4 days for 2 weeks. Quantification was performed with MetaMorph Offline Version 7.5.0.0 (Molecular Devices).
Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were submitted to a dual-color FISH assay using the laboratory developed NTRK1 break-apart probe (3' NTRK1 [SpectrumRed] and 5' NTRK1 [SpectrumGreen]) or the fusion MPRIP [SpectrumGreen]-NTRK1 [SpectrumRed] probe. The pre-hybridization treatment was performed using the reagents from the Vysis Paraffin Kit IV (Abbott Molecular). Hybridization and analysis was performed as previously described.3,31 Samples were deemed positive for NTRK1 rearrangement if >=15% of tumor cells demonstrated an isolated 3' signal or a separation of 5' and 3' signals that was greater than one signal diameter.
siRNA Transfection
KM12 cells were transfected with 30nM NTRK1 Silencer Select siRNAs (Life Technologies) using siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent (Life Technologies) at 4mL/mL.
Flow Cytometry
Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described.3 Apoptosis was measured using the Vybrant apoptosis YO-PRO/PI kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, KM12 cells were seeded 24 hours prior to treatment at 500,000 cells/well prior to trypsinization and staining.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical studies for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin were performed using standard procedures to exclude the possibility of a thyroid carcinoma, which can also express TTF-1, (Supplementary Fig. 20). Antibody against TTF-1 (Cell Marque, Cat#CMC-573) was applied at 1:100 dilution and thyroglobulin (Signet, Cat#228-13) was applied at 1:25 dilution and incubated at 37degC for 32 min. Detection for TTF-1 was performed using Ventana multiview (UltraView) and detection for thyroglobulin using Ventana Avidin-Biotin (iView).
