Survival trends
One-year survival rose from 66 to 70% in both sexes: after adjustment for differences among deprivation groups, that represents an increase of approximately 2% every 5 years (Table 1, Figure 1). Five-year survival rose more quickly than 1-year survival, from 46% for patients diagnosed during 1986-1990 to approximately 52% for those diagnosed during 1996-1999, a deprivation-adjusted increase of approximately 4% every 5 years. Both rates of increase are statistically significant. For patients diagnosed during 1996-1999, the 5-year relative survival reached 51% for men and 53% for women.
Hybrid analysis of the survival probabilities observed during 2000-2001 (Brenner and Rachet, 2004) suggests that the recent improvement in survival observed during the late 1990s is likely to continue (Figure 1, dashed line). Survival rates predicted for those diagnosed during 2000-2001 are approximately 70-71%, 53-54% and 44-45% at 1, 5 and 10 years after diagnosis, respectively (Table 1).

Deprivation
Survival at 1, 5 and 10 years after diagnosis is substantially and systematically higher among more affluent groups. Among more than 26 000 patients diagnosed during 1996-1999, the differences in 1- and 5-year survival between the most deprived and the most affluent groups were estimated at 5-7% (Table 2, Figure 2).
After adjusting for temporal trends in survival, the fitted deprivation gap is statistically significant in every case, with the exception of 10-year survival for patients diagnosed during 1986-1990.
The deprivation gap in survival has remained fairly stable: the slight widening (approximately -1% every 5 years) is not statistically significant (Table 2). The exception here is 10-year survival for women, where the deprivation gap has increased significantly.
Short-term predictions with hybrid analysis suggest that the socioeconomic differences in survival up to 10 years after diagnosis are likely to remain wide for the foreseeable future (Table 2).

Comment
Steadily improving survival for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in England and Wales during the 1990s continues a trend that has been evident for more than 20 years. Five-year survival for patients diagnosed during the early 1970s was approximately 30%, reaching 40-45% in the 1980s (Coleman et al, 1999) and now 52% for patients diagnosed in the late 1990s. This steady trend probably reflects progress in treatment, especially radiotherapy and chemotherapy, since the early 1980s. Survival in England and Wales is still lower than, although close to, figures reported from other western European countries (Sant et al, 2003).
The improvement in overall survival has not led to greater equity in outcome. Survival for the least affluent remains substantially lower than for the most affluent, even after adjustment for the differences and trends in background mortality among deprivation categories; without that adjustment, the observed difference in survival would be even greater.
