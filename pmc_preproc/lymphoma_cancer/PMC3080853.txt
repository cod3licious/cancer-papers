GWAS of Follicular Lymphoma Reveals Allelic Heterogeneity at 6p21.32
                    and Suggests Shared Genetic Susceptibility with Diffuse Large B-cell
                    Lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of hematological                     malignancies, of which follicular lymphoma (FL) is a prevalent subtype. A                     previous genome-wide association study has established a marker, rs10484561 in                     the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region on 6p21.32 associated with                     increased FL risk. Here, in a three-stage genome-wide association study,                     starting with a genome-wide scan of 379 FL cases and 791 controls followed by                     validation in 1,049 cases and 5,790 controls, we identified a second independent                     FL-associated locus on 6p21.32, rs2647012                     (ORcombined = 0.64,                         Pcombined = 2x10-21)                     located 962 bp away from rs10484561 (r2<0.1 in controls). After                     mutual adjustment, the associations at the two SNPs remained genome-wide                     significant (rs2647012:ORadjusted = 0.70,                         Padjusted = 4x10-12;                         rs10484561:ORadjusted = 1.64,                         Padjusted = 5x10-15).                     Haplotype and coalescence analyses indicated that rs2647012 arose on an                     evolutionarily distinct haplotype from that of rs10484561 and tags a novel                     allele with an opposite (protective) effect on FL risk. Moreover, in a follow-up                     analysis of the top 6 FL-associated SNPs in 4,449 cases of other NHL                     subtypes, rs10484561 was associated with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma                         (ORcombined = 1.36,                         Pcombined = 1.4x10-7).                     Our results reveal the presence of allelic heterogeneity within the HLA class II                     region influencing FL susceptibility and indicate a possible shared genetic                     etiology with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These findings suggest that the HLA                     class II region plays a complex yet important role in NHL.

Introduction
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of B- and T-cell malignancies
                of lymphatic origin. The most common subtypes are of B-cell origin and are further
                classified on the basis of their resemblance to normal stages of B-cell
                differentiation [1]. Epidemiological studies indicate that these may have
                different environmental and genetic risk factors, although some etiological factors
                may also be shared [2]. Familial studies provide substantial evidence for a
                genetic influence on susceptibility to the major mature B-cell neoplasms, including
                diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic
                lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) [3], [4]. Recent genome-wide association
                studies (GWAS) of the FL subtype of NHL identified associations with two variants
                within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, one at 6p21.33 (rs6457327) [5] and the other
                at 6p21.32 (rs10484561) [6]. Additional true associations, particularly in the HLA
                region, may have been missed because a limited number of samples were used in the
                initial genome-wide screens, and the selection of a few top single nucleotide
                polymorphisms (SNPs) for validation is further subject to chance. In this study, we
                conducted a larger independent genome-wide scan of FL using 379 cases and 791
                controls from the Scandinavian Lymphoma Etiology (SCALE) study of Sweden and
                Denmark, which was used in the validation of the previous GWAS [6]. This scan was followed by two
                stages of validation in European-ancestry cases of FL and other common B-cell NHL
                subtypes and controls from the US, Canada and Australia (Table 1, Table S1, Table S2, Figure 1).

Results
In total, 298,168 SNPs were analyzed in Stage 1 (l = 1.028;
                    l1000 = 1.055 [7]), in which we observed
                suggestive associations (adjusted trend P-value<10-5) at 4q32.3,
                6p21.32 and 10q25.3 (Table S3) with the strongest at rs2647012 (odds ratio
                (OR) = 0.58, PPCAadjusted =
                    1.59x10-7) within the HLA class II region on 6p21.32. Sixteen
                SNPs in close proximity to the HLA-DQ genes showed association with
                adjusted P-values<10-4, including the previously reported
                rs10484561 (Figure 2, Table S4) [6]. The previously
                reported HLA class I associated SNP rs6457327 [5] was modestly associated with FL
                risk (OR = 0.82, P = 0.03) in Stage 1, and
                was not in linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2 = 0) with
                any of the top 100 SNPs.
In Stage 2, we carried out an in silico validation of the top 40
                SNPs from Stage 1 (Table S5) in 213 FL cases and 750 controls from the San Francisco Bay
                Area, USA (Table 1), the study
                that reported an association at 6p21.32 [6]. Among 38 out of 40 SNPs, seven
                showed association (P<0.05) in Stage 2 (Table S5), six of which were located within the
                6p21.32 region. We tested the independence of multiple association signals in
                6p21.32 using a stepwise logistic regression analysis (entering SNPs based on a
                criterion of likelihood ratio test p-value<0.05) and found that with rs2647012
                (the top SNP within the region) forced in the model, only the addition of rs10484561
                contributed significantly to the association with increased risk of FL. The OR for
                this SNP, adjusted for rs2647012, was 1.43, P = 0.006 (Table S6).

                        independent association and their respective P-values are labeled (blue:
                        rs2647012, green: rs10484561); other SNPs are color-coded according to their
                        LD with rs2647012 (red r2>0.8, orange 0.5-0.8, grey
                        0.2-0.5, white <0.2).
After excluding previously identified and non-independent association signals, we
                selected rs2647012, and an additional four top SNPs to be taken forward to a third
                stage (Table
                    S7, S8), wherein these were genotyped in 836 FL cases and 3202 controls from
                the Mayo Clinic (US) [8], National Cancer Institute-Surveillance, Epidemiology and
                End Results (NCI-SEER, US) [9], Yale University (US) [10], New South Wales (NSW,
                Australia) [11]
                and British Columbia (BC, Canada) [12] studies. The association of rs2647012 with FL was
                validated, showing consistent associations with similar ORs (no heterogeneity,
                P = 0.32) across all independent studies and reaching
                genome-wide significance in both the combined analysis of the validation samples
                    (P = 3x10-15) and the combined
                analysis of all three stages (1428 FL cases, 4743 controls;
                OR = 0.64,
                    P = 2x10-21) (Table.2, Figure 3). After adjustment for rs10484561, the
                association at rs2647012 remained genome-wide significant with minimal change in
                magnitude (ORadjusted = 0.70,
                    Padjusted = 4x10-12). The
                LD between the two SNPs is low (r2<0.1 in the SCALE controls and
                HapMap CEU [Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry]
                samples release27). Taken together, our results suggest that the association at
                rs2647012 is independent from rs10484561, and tags a different disease-predisposing
                variant. We also found suggestive evidence for an association at rs6536942 on 4q32.3
                (OR = 1.36,
                    P = 2x10-5) (Table 2, Figure S1A).

To fine-map the association signals in the HLA class II region, we imputed 10,639
                SNPs within 600 kb surrounding the top SNP rs2647012 using data from the 1000
                Genomes (1000G, 60 CEU subjects, August 2009) and HapMap projects (HapMapII release
                22, CEU) in Stage 1. Among the imputed SNPs, 258 SNPs located in a strong LD block
                of 236 kb (r2>0.8) showed stronger evidence of association than all
                the genotyped SNPs within the region (Figure S2). Since a moderate discordance of
                reference genotypes was observed between 1000 G and HapMapII, we analyzed only SNPs
                showing a concordance of >95% in the two datasets and identified the
                strongest association at rs9378212 (OR = 1.66,
                    P = 3.21x10-8), located 219 kb
                upstream of rs2647012 (r2 = 0.56 in controls). We
                subsequently confirmed the imputed genotypes by Taqman genotyping in 345 of the FL
                case subjects used in Stage 1 and found a 99.4% concordance with the imputed
                genotypes, demonstrating high confidence in the results of the imputation.
Next, we performed a haplotype analysis using rs2647012, rs10484561 and an additional
                12 adjacent genotyped SNPs located within a block of minimal recombination. Out of
                the eight haplotypes identified, three were neutral
                (OR = 0.9-1.1), three increased risk (ORs>1.2;
                strongest risk haplotype tagged by rs10484561) and two were protective (OR<=0.8;
                both tagged by rs2647012) (Table S9), suggesting the presence of at least
                two susceptibility alleles within the region. Coalescence analysis of the eight
                haplotypes indicated that rs2647012 and rs10484561 arose on two distal branches of
                the ancestral recombination graph [13] (Figure S3), which was also supported by the
                analysis of median-joining network [14] using seven SNPs without any recombination (Figure 4). Further haplotype
                analysis of the seven genotyped SNPs (Table S9) and the imputed SNP rs9378212 indicated
                that the two alleles of rs9378212 tag the two different evolutionary lineages (Figure 4), each harboring either
                rs2647012 or rs10484561. Thus, the associations at the two SNPs are likely due to
                two distinct susceptibility variants, instead of a single risk allele, that arose
                independently on different haplotype backgrounds.

                        frequency. SNPs are shown on the links (black lines). SNPs and haplotypes
                        associated with increased or decreased FL risk are labeled in red or blue,
                        respectively. The percentage of alleles of the imputed SNP rs9378212 (C/T)
                        phased on each haplotype are shown in bold.
The FL-associated SNP, rs10484561, was previously found to tag the extended haplotype
                    HLA-DQA1*0101-HLA-DQB1*0501-HLA-DRB1*0101
[6]. Here, to test
                whether any HLA class II alleles may also be responsible for the observed
                association at rs2647012, we imputed known HLA tag SNPs [15], [16] using data from the 1000G and
                HapMapII European datasets. We confirmed the association of the
                    HLA-DRB1*0101-HLA-DQA1*0101-HLA-DQB1*0501 extended
                haplotype, tagged by rs10484561. The association at rs2647012 remained significant
                after adjustment for these three HLA alleles (OR = 0.64,
                    P = 8.11x10-6), suggesting that
                these are not driving the association at rs2647012. Furthermore, rs2647012 was not
                in strong LD (r2<0.8 in HapMap CEU or SCALE controls) with any other
                known HLA tags [15], including those tagging FL-associated alleles previously
                reported [17], [18]
                (r2<0.39 with the six HLA-DRB1*13 tag SNPs
                [rs2395173, rs2157051, rs4434496, rs6901541, rs424232, rs2050191] [17] and
                r2<0.25 with the three HLA-B*0801 and
                    HLA-DRB*0301 tag SNPs [rs6457374, rs2844535,
                rs2040410] [15]). Of the other 17 HLA class II alleles (~39%
                of all the class II alleles) that could be imputed, none showed significant
                association or were found to be responsible for the association at rs2647012 (Table S10).
                Detailed HLA allelotyping on large numbers of cases and controls is needed to
                determine if particular HLA class II alleles are responsible for the observed
                association at rs2647012.
To assess whether the FL-associated SNPs may be involved in the development of other
                NHL subtypes, we genotyped the five SNPs selected for Stage 3 together with
                rs10484561 in a total of 1592 DLBCL, 1075 CLL/SLL, 336 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL),
                262 mantle cell lymphoma, 306 T-cell lymphoma and 878 rare or unspecified NHL cases
                and 5220 controls from the SCALE2, SF2, BC, Mayo, NCI-SEER, Yale and NSW studies
                    (Table 1, Table S1, Figure 1). Among these SNPs,
                rs10484561 showed evidence of association with DLBCL
                (OR = 1.36,
                    P = 1.41x10-7) (Figure S1B) and
                all NHL (OR = 1.23,
                    P = 6.81x10-7). ORs were consistent
                across the seven studies. There was also a suggestive association for rs2647012 with
                MZL (OR = 1.32,
                    P = 6.34x10-4) (Table.3), consistent across six
                studies.
Finally, we investigated the possibility of additional susceptibility loci for FL
                outside of the HLA region by performing a joint analysis of the top 41 to 1000
                variants of our scan and the previously published GWAS of follicular lymphoma [6]. From this
                combined analysis, we did not find any additional markers with a strong association
                    (P<10-6) with FL that were not in LD with our top 5 markers
                taken forward to stage 3 (data not shown).

Discussion
Through the identification of a second variant, rs2647012, that is independent of the
                previously identified risk variant rs10484561 [6] within the 6p21.32 region, our
                findings substantiate a major link between HLA class II loci and genetic
                susceptibility to FL. In addition, our study revealed evidence that rs10484561 is
                associated with DLBCL risk suggesting some shared biological mechanisms of
                susceptibility between these two common NHL subtypes. The association of rs2647012
                with FL risk was not detected in earlier GWAS studies [5], [6], and that of rs10484561 with
                DLBCL risk previously reported was only marginal [6], perhaps because of the smaller
                sample sizes in Stage 1. The number of FL cases scanned in this study was almost
                double compared to the previous individual GWAS [6].
HLA class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells such as
                B-lymphocytes, and act to present exogenous antigens to CD4+ helper T-cells.
                Efficiency of antigen presentation may influence lymphomagenesis through effects on
                anti-tumor immunity or on immune response to infections that are directly or
                indirectly oncogenic (e.g., through viral genome insertion or nonspecific chronic
                antigenic stimulation) [19]. Allelic variants in coding regions may affect the
                structure of the peptide binding groove of the class II molecules, leading to
                differences in the efficiency of oncogenic peptide binding or T-cell recognition.
                Coding sequence variation in the molecules encoded by the extended
                    HLA-DRB1*0101-HLA-DQA1*0101-HLA-DQB1*0501 haplotype
                may be responsible for the association at rs10484561 [6].
Alternatively, variants in the regulatory sequences may influence the expression
                level of the HLA molecules and consequently the efficiency of antigen presentation.
                We note that rs2647012 is strongly associated with the average expression levels of
                    HLA-DRB4 (b = 0.78,
                    P = 3.4x10-22) and
                    HLA-DQA1 (b = -0.58,
                    P = 5.1x10-13) probes in
                Epstein-Barr virus-transfected lymphoblastoid cell lines (mRNA by SNP browser) [20], and rs10484561
                is also associated with the expression levels of HLA-DQA1 probes
                (b = -0.884,
                    P = 1.6x10-10). We speculate that
                this may be an alternative mechanism underlying the observed associations,
                especially at rs2647012.
Interestingly, SNPs within the same LD block harboring rs2647012
                (r2>0.7 in HapMap CEU) have previously been associated with rheumatoid
                arthritis with the same direction of effect [21]. Since autoimmune disorders
                such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren syndrome are associated with increased
                risk of NHL, in particular with DLBCL but also with FL [22], our finding may suggest a
                molecular link between these diseases, although their associations within this
                region of high LD could also be due to different causal variants.
Previously, large-scale candidate gene studies have pointed to susceptibility loci in
                the HLA class III region mainly between the TNF variant
                    -308G->A (rs1800629) and risk of DLBCL [23], [24]. We provide
                novel evidence of association of DLBCL with an independent HLA marker in the class
                II region (rs10484561; r2 = 0), 1.1Mb away from
                rs1800629, strongly suggesting that alleles in the HLA class II region may play an
                important role in the pathogenesis of this subtype as well. The weaker association
                of rs10484561 with DLBCL (OR 1.36) than with FL (OR 1.95) [6] could imply that the
                DLBCL-association is confined to a subset of DLBCL tumors with specific
                morphological or molecular features more closely related to FL, such as the germinal
                center-like B-cell phenotype [25]. However, the observed effects could also be due to
                modification of other concurrent DLBCL-specific susceptibility variants, or
                rs10484561 could tag a more strongly associated marker in this region of high
                LD.
Moreover, we found suggestive evidence of association at rs6536942 on 4q32.3, located
                within an intron of the tolloid-like 1 (TLL1) gene, with FL risk.
                However, larger studies are needed to validate this finding. Although the strongest
                associations so far have been observed in the HLA region, and extended pooling of
                available scan data failed to identify additional loci outside of HLA, we expect
                that future larger meta-GWAS efforts will more robustly identify additional loci in
                other regions.
In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that future genetic and functional work
                focused on the HLA class II region will provide important insight into the disease
                pathology of FL, DLBCL and other subtypes of NHL. In addition, further studies of
                this region and potential interaction with environmental factors in NHL risk, and of
                NHL prognosis are warranted.

Study subjects
The SCALE study is a population-based study of the etiology of NHL carried out in
                    all of Denmark and Sweden during 1999 to 2002 [26]. NHL subtype diagnoses were
                    reviewed and reclassified according to the World Health Organization (WHO)
                    classification [1] as previously described [26]. For this GWAS (SCALE1) we
                    used DNA from 400 cases with follicular lymphoma (FL; 150 from Denmark and 250
                    from Sweden) and from 150 Danish controls, individually matched to the Danish FL
                    cases by sex and age at study inclusion. We also used material collected from
                    673 control subjects in a separate Swedish population-based case-control study
                    of rheumatoid arthritis (the Eira study) [21], [27]. The latter was conducted
                    during 1996 to 2005 among residents 18 to 70 years of age in the southern and
                    central parts of Sweden (including 90% of Swedish residents). Hence, the
                    population controls recruited in this study were considered to represent the
                    same study population as the Swedish component of the SCALE study with regard to
                    genetic variation. Genotyping completion rates were similar between cases and
                    controls; out of 400 cases and 823 controls genotyped, 379 cases (95%)
                    and 791 controls (96%) were included in the final analysis. Study
                    subjects used in Stages 2, 3 and validation in other NHL subtypes (Table 1, Table S1,
                        S2)
                    have been previously described [6], [8]-[12], and details are
                    available as supporting text (Text S1). For the SCALE2 NHL subtype
                    validation study, we used the rest of the lymphoma cases with blood samples
                    originally recruited in SCALE (n = 1869), Danish control
                    subjects not included in the GWAS (n = 556), a second set
                    of control subjects from the Eira study (n = 742) and a
                    third group of controls recruited in a national population-based case-control
                    study of breast cancer, the Cancer and Hormones Replacement in Sweden (CAHRES)
                    study [28]
                    (n = 720). The control subjects from this study were
                    randomly selected from the Swedish general population to match the expected age
                    distribution of the participating breast cancer cases (50 to 74 years).
Genotyping
Stage I genotyping of 317,503 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was done on
                    the HumanHap300 (version 1.0) array. Validation genotyping was done using
                    Sequenom iPlex; SNPs in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region that failed
                    primer design for Sequenom assays were genotyped using Taqman (Applied
                    Biosystems).
Genome-wide association study
The scan included 317,503 SNPs from the HumanHap300 (version 1.0) array. The
                    datasets were filtered on the basis of SNP genotyping call rates
                    (>=>95% completeness), sample completion rate (>=90%),
                    minor allele frequency (MAF; all subjects as well as cases and controls
                    separately >=0.03) and non-deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE;
                        p<10-6). We also excluded SNPs with cluster plot
                    problems, and those on the X and Y chromosomes. Study subjects with gender
                    discrepancies and/or labelling errors were removed. We also removed individual
                    samples with evidence of cryptic family relationships (identified using
                    the-genome command in PLINK). To detect outliers in terms of population
                    stratification, we performed principal component (PC) analysis using the
                    EIGENSTRAT software (Figure S4). A subset of linkage
                    disequilibrium (LD) thinned SNPs was selected such that all pair-wise
                    associations had r2<0.2, and long-range regions of high LD,
                    reported to potentially confound genome scans, were removed [29]. Twenty-five
                    samples were removed as population outliers on the basis of their values on the
                    first three PCs. To adjust for possible stratification in our association
                    analyses we adjusted the regression analyses using the first three PCs; the
                    number of PCs used for adjustment was determined by plotting the eigenvalues and
                    locating the position of the "elbow" on the scree plot (Figure S5).
                    Wald tests, treating minor allele counts as continuous covariates were used to
                    test for association. The genomic inflation factor (l) was calculated to be
                    1.0283 after adjusting for the first three PCs, suggesting the presence of
                    minimal stratification. Quantile-quantile plots for the associations before and
                    after adjustment are shown in Figure S6. Finally, we assessed associations
                    of age and sex with main genotypes among the control subjects to address the
                    possibility of confounding by these factors (Table S11).
                    As there was no evidence of associations of age or sex with genotypes among the
                    controls, we did not adjust for them in the final main effects analyses of
                    genotypes.
Validation and meta-analysis
In Stage 2, similar quality control measures were applied as in Stage 1,
                    including genotyping call rate >=95%, sample completion rate
                    >=90%, and MAF >=0.05. We tested each validation study for
                    association using trend tests. For meta-analyses across studies and NHL
                    subtypes, we used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate the combined
                    odds ratio and P-value, and kh2 tests for heterogeneity.
                    Multivariate logistic regression was used to test for independence of SNP
                    effects. For validation among other NHL subtypes, the control subjects were the
                    same as those in Stages 2 and 3 for validation in FL for all studies except
                    SCALE2. Only European-ancestry subjects were included, and the possibility of
                    population stratification affecting the results has been thoroughly explored and
                    found to be low in earlier investigations in the same populations [6], [8].
Imputation
We used IMPUTEv1 for the imputation of SNPs from the 1000 Genomes pilot1 CEU data
                    (August 2009 release); and the HapMap Phase II release 22 CEU data. We set a
                    strict threshold for imputation, using only SNPs with confidence scores of
                    >=0.9, call rates >=90%, non-deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
                    equilibrium P >0.001 and MAF >0.01. The imputation was done on the Stage 1
                    samples separately for each of the two reference datasets and SNPs showing a
                    discordance of >5% between the genotypes imputed with the two datasets
                    were excluded from further analysis. The data were then merged using HapMap II
                    as the master dataset to which additional imputed SNPs from the 1000 Genomes
                    dataset were added. HLA alleles were imputed by identifying tag SNPs [15] from the
                    genotyped and imputed SNP dataset. We used PLINK for haplotype imputation with
                    the tag SNPs and downstream association analyses. Only haplotypes with call
                    rates >90%, MAF>1% and probability thresholds >0.8 were
                    analyzed.
Haplotype and coalescence analyses
For coalescence analysis all 12 SNPs (genotyped in this study and within a region
                    of ~177 Kb) adjacent to the two SNPs associated with the FL risk were used
                    to construct haplotypes. These were phased using the PHASE program [30] and
                    tested for association using PLINK. The ancestral haplotype was constructed from
                    the chimpanzee (PanTro2) allele whenever possible, and otherwise from the
                    macaque alleles. An ancestral recombination graph was constructed using the
                    program Beagle [13], [31] which allows recombination assuming an infinite site
                    mutation model. After identifying the first recombination event the haplotype
                    segment before the recombination spot was used to construct a median
                    -joining network using the Network program [14]. The alleles of the
                    imputed SNP rs9378212 were then phased on each haplotype segment using the PHASE
                    program.
