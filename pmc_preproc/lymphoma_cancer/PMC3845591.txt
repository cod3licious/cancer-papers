[Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion]

The incidences and mortalities of major cancers in China, 2009. In 2012, the National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) of China collected cancer registration information for the year 2009 from local cancer registries and analyzed it to describe the incidences and mortalities of cancers in China. Based on the data quality criteria from NCCR, data from 104 registries covering 85,470,522 people (57,489,009 in urban areas and 27,981,513 in rural areas) were checked and evaluated. The data from 72 registries were qualified and accepted for the cancer registry annual report in 2012. The total cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The morphologically verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of the incident cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (317.97/100,000 in males and 253.09/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for incidences based on the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and the world standard population (ASRIW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000, respectively, with a cumulative incidence of 22.08%. The cancer mortality in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for mortalities based on the Chinese standard population (ASRMC) and the world standard population (ASRMW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000, respectively, and the cumulative mortality was 12.94%. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer, and cervical cancer were the most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia, and lymphoma accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. The cancer registration's population coverage has been increasing, and its data quality is improving. As the basis of the cancer control program, the cancer registry plays an important role in directing anticancer strategies in the medium and long term. Because cancer burdens are different in urban and rural areas in China, prevention and control efforts should be based on practical situations.

Materials and Methods
Data source
One hundred four cancer registries from 26 provinces, including 46 urban registries and 58 rural registries, submitted cancer registration data in 2009. The coverage population of all 104 registries was 109,476,347(55,654,485 males and 53,821,862 females), accounting for 8.20% of the entire national population by the end of 2009. The total cancer incident cases were 284,470 (160,958 males and 123,512 females), and the total number of deaths was 174,879 (110,311 males and 64,568 females).
Quality control
The proportion of morphologic verification (MV%), the percentage of cancer cases identified by death certification only (DCO%), the mortality-to-incidence ratio (M/I), the percentage of uncertified cancer (UB%), and the percentage of cancer with undefined or unknown primary site (secondary) (O&U%) were used to evaluate the completeness, validity, and reliability of the cancer registration data. According to NCCR's acceptability criteria, the following standards should be reached: MV% higher than 66%, DCO% less than 15%, and M/I ratio between 0.6 and 0.8.
An advantage of cancer registration data is the timely reporting of cancer. However, for the completeness, validity, and reliability of cancer statistics[3], a time gap between data updating and analysis might exist. NCCR ruled that every registry should upload the cancer registry data for 2009 before July 1, 2012, which was 30 months after the reported patients' cancer diagnoses were made.
Statistical analysis
The quality of the data was assessed based on the "Guideline for Chinese Cancer Registration" and referred to the criteria for "Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume IX"[4] by the International Agency for Cancer Registry (IACR) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), respectively. When the cancer registration data met the quality criteria for completeness, comparability, and validity, they were accepted as qualified data for analysis.
Crude incidence and mortality were calculated and age-standardized to the 1982 Chinese population and Segi's world population. The proportion and cumulative rate were also calculated. Database software, including MS-FoxPro, MS-Excel, SAS, and IARC issued by IARC/IACR[5], were used for data checking, evaluation, and analysis.

Results
Data pooling and quality evaluation
The data from 72 registries, including 31 from urban areas and 41 from rural areas, met the criteria for data quality and were pooled to create a national database in 2009. The population coverage of the valid database was 85,470,522 (43,231,554 males and 42,238,968 females), including 57,489,009 in urban areas (67.26%) and 27,981,513 in rural areas (32.74%). The total cancer incident cases and deaths were 244,366 and 137,462, respectively (Table 1).
The overall MV%, DCO%, and M/I ratio were 67.23%, 3.14%, and 0.63, respectively. They were 68.96%, 3.03%, and 0.60 in urban registries, compared with 62.91%, 3.43%, and 0.71 in rural registries.
Incidence and mortality of all cancers
Incidence
The crude incidence of all cancers in the registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (317.97/100,000 in males and 253.09/100,000 in females). The ASIRC was 146.87/100,000, and the ASIRW was 191.72/100,000. Among the patients aged 0-74 years, the cumulative incidence was 22.08%. The crude and age-standardized cancer incidences in urban areas were higher than those in rural areas. Although the crude incidence in males was much higher in urban areas than in rural areas, the age-standardized incidences were similar (Table 2).
Mortality
The crude mortality in the cancer registration areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females). The ASMRC was 85.06/100,000, and the ASMRW was 115.65/100,000. The cumulative mortality (0-74 years) was 12.94%. Urban areas had a higher cancer mortality (181.86/100,000) than rural areas did (177.83/100,000), and both rural and urban areas had similar mortality for males. After age standardization, the mortality in rural areas was higher than that in urban areas for both males and females (Table 3).
Incidence and mortality of major cancers
Cancer incidences of the 10 most common cancers
Lung cancer was the most common cancer in the cancer registration areas, followed by gastric, colorectal, liver, and esophageal cancers. The 10 most common cancers accounted for 76.39% of all new cases, including 84.14% in males and 77.57% in females. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in males, followed by gastric, liver, colorectal, and esophageal cancers. Breast cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in females, followed by lung, colorectal, gastric, and liver cancers (Table 4).
Cancer mortalities of the 10 most common cancers
Lung cancer was the leading cause of death in the cancer registration areas, followed by gastric, liver, esophageal, and colorectal cancers. The 10 most common cancers accounted for 84.27% of all cancer deaths. In males, lung cancer was the leading cause of death, followed by liver, gastric, esophageal, and colorectal cancers; in females, lung cancer was also the leading cause of death, followed by gastric, liver, colorectal, and breast cancers (Table 5).

Discussion
A recent goal of the National Health Care Reform Program of China is to establish more than 300 registries covering at least one tenth of the population of all rural areas. The year 2009 is the year that the Ministry of Health in China launched the National Program of Cancer Registry. Fifty-two new cancer registries were established based on 43 existing registries supported by central finance through the registry program. According to the NCCR's data submission requirements, 95 registries were expected to submit their 2009 cancer registration data in 2012. As of June 2012, 104 cancer registries had submitted data, a great increase compared with the previous year. In 2012, a total of 222 cancer registries recorded cancer data, covering 200 million people. The number of registries is expected to increase in the coming years. NCCR will focus on improving data quality and expanding the coverage to improve the cancer surveillance system nationwide by establishing the foundations for cancer control.
To ensure the validity of accepted data, NCCR processes the data carefully according to the national criteria issued in the program protocol. The incidence, mortality, and population data must be reasonable compared with the levels for similar populations, for example, those with a similar location, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle. The indicators of completeness and validity, such as MV%, DCO%, M/I ratio, UB%, and 0&U%, were evaluated for every registry's data. Through double evaluations at the provincial and national levels, 72 registries qualified for inclusion, and 32 were considered invalid. The valid data were pooled and analyzed to create the final results for the 2009 annual report.
The cancer incidence and mortality statistics for 2009 were very close to those for 2008[6]. Although the included registries were quite different from those that were included in the 2008 report, the overall cancer incidence and mortality data for the two years were reasonably stable, indicating that the pooled data were valid and could represent the cancer burden at the national level. The representativeness of the cancer registry for different groups, such as urban and rural populations and various regions, should be evaluated[7].
The cancer patterns differ considerably between urban and rural areas in China[8]. In urban areas, lung cancer, female breast cancer, and colorectal cancer are major cancers with higher incidences than in rural areas. However, cancers of the digestive system, such as esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and liver cancer, are common in rural areas. The overall cancer incidence in urban areas is higher and mortality is lower than those in rural areas[8],[9]. This difference is the result of limited medical resources, a relatively low level of cancer diagnosis and treatment, and a lack of health education in rural areas. In urban areas, the cancer spectrum is tending toward the characteristics of developed countries. The burdens of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and female breast cancer continue to increase. Cancer in rural areas still retains the cancer patterns of developing countries. Thus, the emphasis of cancer control should consider these differences and implement efficient strategies based on cancer surveillance results.
Currently, the Ministry of Health is developing an action plan for preventing and controlling noncommunicable diseases in the twelfth 5-year plan. Cancer is a major disease seriously threatening people's health in China. The emphasis in rural areas would focus on professional training in primary care centers, health education/promotion, and early diagnosis/treatment, especially for cancers that are common in rural areas, such as esophageal, gastric, cervical, and liver cancers. In cities, behavioral interventions, such as tobacco control and healthy lifestyle promotion, should be enhanced, and high-risk groups should undergo cancer screening to achieve the goal of reducing cancer mortality within a short time.
