Synergistic anti-tumor activity of acadesine (AICAR) in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in in vivo and in vitro models of mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is considered one of the most challenging lymphoma, with limited responses to current therapies. Acadesine, a nucleoside analogue has shown antitumoral effects in different preclinical cancer models as well as in a recent phase I/II clinical trial conducted in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here we observed that acadesine exerted a selective antitumoral activity in the majority of MCL cell lines and primary MCL samples, independently of adverse cytogenetic factors. Moreover, acadesine was highly synergistic, both in vitro and in vivo, with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, commonly used in combination therapy for MCL. Gene expression profiling analysis in harvested tumors suggested that acadesine modulates immune response, actin cytoskeleton organization and metal binding, pointing out a substantial impact on metabolic processes by the nucleoside analog. Rituximab also induced changes on metal binding and immune responses. The combination of both drugs enhanced the gene signature corresponding to each single agent, showing an enrichment of genes involved in inflammation, metabolic stress, apoptosis and proliferation. These effects could be important as aberrant apoptotic and proinflammatory pathways play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MCL. In summary, our results suggest that acadesine exerts a cytotoxic effect in MCL in combination with rituximab, by decreasing the proliferative and survival signatures of the disease, thus supporting the clinical examination of this strategy in MCL patients.

INTRODUCTION
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents 5-10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) and is one of the most aggressive lymphoid neoplasms with poor prognosis. Its genetic hallmark is the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which leads to cyclin D1 overexpression with the consequent cell cycle deregulation [1]. MCL cells carry a high number of secondary genetic alterations that increase the oncogenic potential of cyclin D1 and frequently inactivate the cellular response to DNA damage. In addition, other mechanisms such as activation of cell survival pathways are integrated to drive MCL pathogenesis. Current frontline combination chemotherapies and intensive chemoimmunotherapy followed by stem-cell transplantation have improved the outcome for patients with this disease [2]. Although these regimens have high initial response rates, most patients relapse and die from disease-related complications [1]. The introduction of rituximab, a chimeric mouse anti-human CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown improvement of response rates when used in combination with standard chemotherapy [3;4]. In the last years, new strategies that target crucial biological pathways such as ubiquitin-proteasome system, mTOR pathway and BCR signaling have been developed [2;5;6]. In particular, recently it has been described that Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor shows durable single-agent efficacy in relapsed or refractory MCL [7]. Acadesine (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-D-ribofuranoside, AICA-riboside or AICAR) is a nucleoside analogue initially developed as a cardioprotective agent, with a different mechanism of action compared to standard nucleoside analogues, like fludarabine [8]. When added to cell cultures or administered to animals or humans, acadesine is phosphorylated to AICA-ribotide (ZMP), the natural endogenous intermediate in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, which can function as an AMP mimic and activate AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), a protein that regulates the responses of the cell to energy changes [9]. Although acadesine is commonly used as an AMPK activator, there are compelling evidences that acadesine anti tumoral effects could be mediated, at least in part, independently of the AMPK pathway [10-13]. Nevertheless, at present, the exact nature of the AMPK-independent effects of acadesine in leukemic cells is not clearly understood. Many studies have shown that acadesine can inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma [14], neuroblastoma [15], glioblastoma [16], childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [17], colon cancer [18], and breast and prostate cancer cell lines [19]. In particular, acadesine exerts a pro-apoptotic activity in a wide range of B lymphoid malignancies [20], being cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) the most sensitive to this agent [13;21]. Recently, a phase I/II clinical trial conducted in relapsed/refractory CLL patients has demonstrated a remarkable activity of the drug in the clinical settings [22].
In this study, we show that acadesine exerts a specific antitumoral activity in the majority of MCL cell lines and primary samples, and synergizes with rituximab both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we provide gene expression profiling (GEP) data on the putative mechanisms of action of acadesine-rituximab combination, supporting clinical examination of this strategy in MCL patients.

RESULTS
Acadesine exerts a cytotoxic effect both in MCL cell lines and MCL primary samples
Nine MCL cell lines were exposed for 24 or 48 hours to increasing doses of acadesine ranging from 0.1 to 2 mM, and IC50 and LD50 values were calculated from data obtained by the MTT and the Annexin V assays, respectively. As shown on Table 1, most of the cell lines analyzed (REC-1, JEKO-1, UPN-1, JVM-2, MAVER-1 and Z-138) showed a IC50 lower than 1 mM after 48 hours of acadesine incubation. Three cell lines (MINO, HBL-2 and GRANTA-519), showed a IC50 higher than 2 mM, the maximum dose tested. The analysis of the LD50 values followed the same pattern, being REC-1, JEKO-1 and UPN-1 the most sensitive cell lines to acadesine-induced cell death, with LD50 below 1 mM after 48 hours of incubation (Figure 1A and 1C). Z-138, JVM-2 and MAVER-1 cell lines showed LD50 around 1.5 mM at 48 hours and, accordingly to the MTT assay results, MINO, HBL-2 and GRANTA-519 exhibited low sensitivity to acadesine with a not-reachable LD50. Acadesine-evoked cell death increased in a time- and a dose-dependent manner, as illustrated in Figure 1A. Deletion at 17p, affecting TP53 or the total amount of copy number alterations (CNA), including trisomies or monosomies that carried most of the MCL cell lines (Table 1) did not affect the susceptibility of MCL cells to acadesine.

Primary MCL cells were incubated with acadesine 1 mM and 2 mM for 24 hours and cytotoxicity was measured as above. Data show the mean +- SEM of three replicates. C.

Results show the mean cytotoxicity of 10 primary MCL samples +- SEM analyzed after incubation with acadesine 2 mM for 24 hours. (** P< 0.01, *** P< 0.001)
Then, isolated tumor cells from 15 MCL samples were exposed for 24 hours to acadesine 1 and 2 mM, and cell viability was analyzed by annexin V labeling. As shown on Table 1 and illustrated on figure 1C, similarly to what observed in MCL cell lines, acadesine also induced apoptosis in primary patient cells, even though this effect was heterogeneous among our set of MCL primary cultures (Figure 1B). Six out of fifteen cases (40%) showed a response above 25 % to 1 mM acadesine, while 12 of 15 cases (80%) achieved these responses at 2 mM acadesine, being the mean cytotoxicity at this dose 48.28 +- 27.97%. Again, no association could be observed between the response to acadesine and the presence of TP53 anomalies and CNAs in the set of primary MCL samples studied. Despite all of them harbored a high percentage of tumoral B-cells (range 76-97%) (Table 1), we analyzed the activity of acadesine in B-tumoral and the accompanying T-cells in 10 out of the 15 MCL cases studied. Using a triple CD19/CD3/Annexin V labeling, we found that B tumor cells (CD19+) were significantly more sensitive to a 2 mM dose of the drug than the normal T-cell subset, both at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 1D, P0.01 at 24 hours and P0.001 at 48 hours).
Altogether, these results suggest that acadesine is active in the majority of MCL cell lines and primary samples, where it exerts a selective antitumoral effect, regardless of genetic alterations and adverse prognostic factors.

Acadesine and rituximab exert a synergistic cytotoxic effect
We further investigated potential interactions of acadesine with drugs currently approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL, including bortezomib, bendamustine and rituximab. For this aim, a panel of MCL cell lines were incubated for 48 hours with two different doses of acadesine (0.5 and 1 mM), bortezomib (2.5 and 5 nM) and bendamustine (25 and 50 mM). Rituximab experiments were performed after incubation of cells for 24 h with acadesine, followed by an additional 24 h incubation with or without two different concentrations of rituximab (20 and 40 mg/mL), except for JEKO-1 cells where rituximab was used at 1 and 2 mg/ml. Inhibition of proliferation was measured using the MTT assay. Then the combination index (CI) using the Chou and Talalay method were evaluated for each drug combination and represented in Figure 2A. An antagonistic effect was observed when acadesine was combined with 5 nM bortezomib. When used in combination with bendamustine 25 mM, acadesine displayed either additive or synergistic cytotoxic activity, depending on the MCL cell line, and being the cell lines carrying a P53 wild type phenotype those with the higher synergistic effect between these two drugs. Interestingly, a synergistic effect of acadesine plus rituximab was observed in 7 out of the 9 MCL cell lines tested, with CI values ranging from 0.400 to 0.918, with no correlation with any known MCL genetic alteration (Table 1). The two remaining MCL cell lines (MAVER-1 and GRANTA-519), showed CI values closed to 1, indicative of an additive or a slightly antagonistic effect.

The graph shows the CI of the combination of acadesine 1 mM with bortezomib 5 nM, bendamustine 25 mM, and rituximab 40 mg/ml (1 mg/ml for JEKO-1) for each cell line. The combinations with CI  2 are not shown in the graph. B. Combination of acadesine with rituximab in JEKO-1 cell line. Cells were pre-incubated for 24 hours with acadesine, followed by a 24-hour exposure to rituximab. Inhibition of proliferation was analyzed by the MTT assay. Data show the results of three independent experiments +- SEM and CI are indicated above the bars. C. Combination of acadesine with rituximab in MCL primary samples. Primary cells were incubated with acadesine and rituximab as above. Data show the mean of 5 samples +- SEM and CI are indicated above the bars.
In 5 MCL primary samples, the combination of acadesine with rituximab was also synergistic at all the concentrations tested (Table 1), being the best drug interaction obtained with acadesine 1 mM and rituximab 40 mg/ml (mean CI = 0.597 +- 0.102, Figure 2C). Importantly, the synergistic effect observed in primary MCL cells was independent of the initial response to acadesine, being rituximab able to sensitize MCL cells and to overcome their resistance to the nucleoside analog.
To validate the specificity of the cooperation between acadesine and rituximab in MCL, we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of both drugs either alone or in combination in two CLL cell lines, namely MEC-1 and MEC-2, and in a set of 4 primary CLL cultures. We observed that in CLL cells the acadesine-combination lacked the synergistic activity observed in MCL cells, with CI values ranging from 1.181 to 8.336, being additive in the MEC-1 cell line and antagonistic in the MEC-2 cell line, as well as in all the CLL primary samples tested (data not shown).
Altogether, these results suggest that among the standard agents currently used in the clinical, rituximab presents the best combinational activity with acadesine, and that this effect may be specific for the MCL model.

The combination of acadesine and rituximab inhibits tumor outgrowth in a mouse xenograft model of MCL
To validate the synergism between acadesine and rituximab observed in JEKO-1, we evaluated the antitumoral effect of this combination in a CB17-SCID mouse xenograft model of MCL generated using this cell line. Animals were randomly assigned into different groups with 6 mice per cohort and treated with acadesine at dose level of 400 mg/kg body weight five days a week, rituximab at 10 mg/kg body weight once a week, both drugs as above or the equivalent volume of vehicle. When compared to vehicle-treated mice, after 18 days of treatment, we observed that tumor burden was significantly reduced in mice treated either with acadesine (P0.01) or with rituximab (P0.001) as single agents. We observed a reduction in tumor size of 31.22 +- 15.68% in acadesine-receiving animals and of 63.85 +- 10.88% in the rituximab arm. The combination of both agents was significantly more effective than the two drugs alone (P0.001 compared to acadesine, P0.01 respect to rituximab) leading to an almost complete inhibition of tumor growth (Figure 3A). Mice tolerated well the treatment, and no effect on animal vital parameters was reported, in any of the treatment arms. Thus, these results suggest that the combination of acadesine with rituximab might represent a safe and efficient therapeutic approach for the treatment of MCL tumors.

The combination of acadesine and rituximab modulates genes related to inflammation, metabolic stress, proliferation and survival pathways in MCL
In order to understand the basis of the synergy between acadesine and rituximab, we next examined changes in gene expression profiles in a set of representative harvested tumors from each cohort (n=3 tumors/group). We determined the differentially expressed genes from each treatment compared to the control with a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.2 and an absolute fold change (FC) above 1.4 using the Rank Products method in the TM4-MEV platform. Treating the cells with acadesine was associated with the lowest number of gene modulations (18 genes up-regulated and 41 genes down-regulated), whereas after rituximab treatment 26 genes were up-regulated and 46 genes were down-regulated. Acadesine and rituximab treatment affected the expression of a much higher number of genes, being 481 genes up-regulated and 512 genes down-regulated (Figure 4A and Supplemental Table 1). To gain insight into the biological function of the treatment-related differential expression profiles, we conducted a gene onthology (GO) enrichment analysis using the DAVID application. Both acadesine and rituximab monotherapies were found to be related to an enrichment of genes involved in metal binding and immune response, while genes related to actin cytoskeleton organization and immune response, were more specifically regulated by acadesine and rituximab, respectively. Importantly, the treatment with acadesine-rituximab combination allowed to the identification of the same GO terms, but with improved significance (P0.001). Additionally, an enrichment of genes related to regulation of cell death and cell proliferation was detected in tumors receiving this combination (Table 2). Figure 4B showed an overview of the genes modulated by the combination clustered according to the previous described GO terms.

Histological sections from representative tumors of each treatment stained with hematoxylin and eosin and specific antibodies against metallothionein, activated caspase-3 and phospho-histone 3 (x40) D. JEKO-1 cells were treated with acadesine, rituximab and the combination after a CD40L + IL-4 stimulation and inhibition of proliferation was measured by MTT assay. Data show the mean of three independent experiments +- SEM. E. Migration assay of JEKO-1 cells treated with acadesine, rituximab and the combination. Graph shows the number of CXCL12-stimulated cells migrating after each treatment.
Then, GSEA was used to identify the gene-sets and pathways modulated by each treatment considering a FDR0.05 (Table 3). For acadesine, the statistically significant normalized enrichment scores (NES) were achieved by the metallothionein node (NES=-1.92) and the WNT pathway (NES=-1.97). In tumors treated with rituximab, we found also an enrichment of the metallothionein node (NES=-1.86). Furthermore, pathways involved in B/T cell calcium signaling (NES=-1.87), CD40 (NES=-1.89) and NF-kB pathways (NES=-1.91) were also down-regulated. A significant regulation of all these pathways, except for WNT, was also observed in tumors treated with the drug combination. Additionally, we observed down-regulation of genes involved in inflammatory response (NES=-2.02), apoptosis (NES=-1.88), metabolic stress (NES=-1.87), as well as interferon signaling (NES=-2.82) and Toll pathway (NES=-1.83), both of them involved in inflammation (Table 3).
In an attempt to validate the relevance of some of these profiles at the functional level, we first selected to analyze the variation of the metallothionein node, by immunohistochemical detection of metallothionein proteins in the different treatment groups. For this aim, histologic sections from representative whole tumors were labeled with specific antibodies against metallothionein as indicated in material and methods. As shown on figure 4D (panel MT), and in accordance with our GEP results, down-regulation of MT staining was observed in both acadesine- and rituximab-treated groups, that became almost complete in the combination-treated tumors.
Regarding the immune response profile, as the GSEA analysis identified the cytokine receptor CD40 among the main components of this profile, and as it has been reported that CD40 participates in the survival, cell growth, and drug resistance in MCL [23], we performed a co-stimulation assay of JEKO-1 cells with recombinant CD40L + interleukin-4 (IL4), followed by cell exposure to the different drugs and determination of cell viability. As shown on figure 4D, stimulation of MCL cells with CD40L+IL4 did not prevent the decrease in cell proliferation either in acadesine, rituximab-, or the combination, contrasting with what observed when MCL cells were incubated with bortezomib. These results suggest that CD40 pro-survival signaling does not affect significantly the acadesine-rituximab cytotoxic activity in MCL cells.
Next, as the actin cytoskeleton organization node contained genes related to the migration of cells, we performed chemotaxis assays in JEKO-1 cells exposed to acadesine, rituximab and the combination. We observed that both agents were able to inhibit the migration of JEKO-1 cells, and that this effect was higher in cells treated with the combination (Figure 4E).
Finally, and in agreement with our DAVID analysis, showing that the regulation of cell death and proliferation were significantly affected by acadesine-rituximab combination in MCL tumors, by immunohistochemistry we observed a higher expression of the activated form of caspase-3 (figure 4C, panel act.Casp3) and a reduction in the phosphorylation status of the proliferation marker histone H3 (figure 4C, panel Phospho-H3), in the tumor tissues treated with acadesine plus rituximab, when compared to vehicle- and single agent-treated tumors.
In summary, the combination of both acadesine and rituximab enhanced the gene signature corresponding to each single agent, showing an enrichment of genes involved in inflammation, metabolic stress, apoptosis and proliferation. These effects could be important as aberrant apoptotic and proinflammatory pathways play an important role in the pathogenesis of MCL.
