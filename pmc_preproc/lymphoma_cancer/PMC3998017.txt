[Abstract, Results, Discussion, Methods, Mixed]

Single cell imaging of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase using an irreversible inhibitor. A number of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are currently in development, yet it has been difficult to visualize BTK expression and pharmacological inhibition in vivo in real time. We synthesized a fluorescent, irreversible BTK binder based on the drug Ibrutinib and characterized its behavior in cells and in vivo. We show a 200 nM affinity of the imaging agent, high selectivity, and irreversible binding to its target following initial washout, resulting in surprisingly high target-to-background ratios. In vivo, the imaging agent rapidly distributed to BTK expressing tumor cells, but also to BTK-positive tumor-associated host cells.

Results
We sought to design a bright, fluorescent derivative of an irreversible BTK inhibitor that would preserve the selectivity of the parent drug. As such a model agent, Ibrutinib fits tightly into the ATP binding pocket of BTK, forms an irreversible bond with Cys481, and has a suitable modification point for fluorochrome attachment (PDB: 3GEN, Fig. 1a). A BODIPY-FL modified Ibrutinib (Ibrutinib-BFL) was designed and synthesized de novo in seven steps (Fig. 1b). Briefly, iodination of commercially available pyrazolopyrimidine compound with N-Iodosuccinimide, followed by Suzuki coupling of the product with 4-phenyloxybenzene boronic acid, resulted in compound 2. Mitsunobu reaction of compound 2 with N-Boc-3-hydroxypiperidine resulted in compound 3. After deprotection of the Boc protecting group in acidic conditions, the crude product was coupled with the linker (compound 5) to introduce a Michael acceptor for the irreversible binding affinity. Coupling of the crude Boc-deprotected compound 6 with BODIPY-FL-NHS finalized the synthetic steps to produce Ibrutinib-BFL (7) at an overall yield of ~11%.
To confirm the effect of BFL modification on the inhibition efficacy of the drug, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Ibrutinib and Ibrutinib-BFL were determined against purified BTK enzyme. Ibrutinib-BFL had an IC50 of ~200 nM, which is less potent than the parent drug (~2 nM IC50; data not shown). Although it may be possible to further optimize the affinity of Ibrutinib-BFL by testing various linkers, we found the current generation probe to be quite acceptable for imaging, as shown in subsequent experiments. We next determined whether Ibrutinib-BFL would bind to purified BTK in vitro, endogenous BTK in live cells, and ultimately in vivo. Purified BTK was incubated with varying concentrations of the imaging probe for one hour at room temperature, denatured at 70degC for 10 minutes and then processed for SDS-PAGE gel analysis. There was a clear dose-response increase of the fluorescent signal around 80 kDa (BTK molecular weight is 76 kDa), as well as at the bottom of the gel (unbound fraction of Ibrutinib-BFL) (Fig. 2a). Additionally, binding could be blocked by pre-incubation with the parent compound and silver staining of the gel showed equal loading of BTK protein (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results clearly confirmed the covalent binding property of Ibrutinib-BFL toward purified BTK.
We next performed a similar experiment in lymphoma cells. We first determined BTK expression in several lymphoma cell lines (Daudi Burkitt's Lymphoma line, and DB, Toledo, and RC-K8 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) lines) and one T-cell leukemia line (Jurkat) by Western blot (Supplementary Fig. S1). As expected, T cells did not express BTK. We found high BTK expression in Daudi and Toledo cell lines, and henceforth used Toledo as model BTK-positive cells and Jurkat as negative control cells. Toledo and Jurkat cells were incubated with different doses of Ibrutinib-BFL, and cell lysates were processed for SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorescent gel scanning. The imaging probe showed remarkable specificity, with binding observed only at a single band (Fig. 2b). The specificity was further confirmed by the absence of a band in BTK-negative Jurkat cells, even at the highest concentration of probe (Fig. 2b), as well as by silver staining of the gel (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We next performed live cell imaging experiments using an imaging flow cytometry system. To prepare Toledo and Jurkat cells, we incubated them with 100 nM Ibrutinib-BFL for two hours, followed by washing. Figure 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2 summarize some of the results confirming target binding, specificity via blocking, and the ability to perform live cell imaging. To quantify co-localization between the imaging probe and BTK at the subcellular level, we created a stable transgenic cell line expressing a BTK-mCherry fusion protein in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. In vitro cell experiments showed excellent co-localization and blocking (r2 = 0.9851; Fig. 4).
We next performed in vivo experiments using three-color (blue: vasculature, green: Ibrutinib-BFL, red: BTK-mCherry-HT1080 cells) time-lapse intravital imaging. The intravascular half-life of Ibrutinib-BFL was ~10 minutes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Within an hour after systemic administration, there was extensive leakage of the compound into the tumor interstitium. At later time points, cellular uptake became apparent, presumably due to interstitial washout and/or intracellular accumulation. The ability to image in multiple channels allowed us to ask whether Ibrutinib specifically localized in tumor cells. We show that greater than 99% of all BTK-mCherry-HT1080 cells had achieved therapeutic drug concentrations within one hour. This effective intracellular dose persisted for prolonged periods of time and the compound was still detectable inside cancer cells 24 hours after administration (Fig. 5). Interestingly, there was also accumulation of Ibrutinib-BFL in non-tumor cells even at late time points. Given the exquisite specificity of the drug (see Fig. 2), we hypothesized that these non-target cells also contain BTK. We thus performed correlative immunohistochemistry using anti-BTK antibody. Our data indicates that Ibrutinib-BTK also accumulates in tumor-associated macrophages and lymphocytes (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Inhibition of BTK is emerging as a promising target for B-cell malignancies, other cancers with BTK over-expression, and certain autoimmune diseases where BTK is involved. Ibrutinib, an irreversible inhibitor, is approved for treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and CLL, and is currently undergoing late-stage efficacy studies in patients with various B-cell malignancies. Based on its covalent target binding, we hypothesized that the molecule could serve as a companion imaging agent. Here we show that this is indeed the case. Ibrutinib-BFL co-localized with BTK in BTK-positive malignant cells and had low background accumulation in non-BTK cells, including those expressing structurally related interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), which is expressed in T cells and Jurkat cells (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The companion imaging drug, Ibrutinib-BFL, also showed a predictable dose response curve, could be competitively inhibited, allowed drug concentrations to be quantitated in vivo, and enabled mapping of drug distributions at the single cell level. As such, we believe that Ibrutinib-BFL could have several applications, including use as a companion diagnostic for flow cytometry in haematologic malignancies, as an imaging agent to localize and map BTK-positive tumors, as a method to track subcellular localization of endogenous BTK, and as a tool to measure pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in experimental settings during development of novel BTK-pathway inhibitors.
BTK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase belonging to the Tec family. It is expressed in the B-cell lineage, plays a pivotal role in signaling and development, and is highly active in several haematological malignancies2829. Some previous BTK imaging has been done with fluorescent protein tags (BTK-GFP and BTK-mCherry) to understand its activation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling303132, and its roles in myeloid cell chemotaxis33 and infection3435. Alternative research methods have primarily involved fluorescently labeled antibodies for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry applications. The former is limited to experimental models and requires protein over-expression, and the latter requires cell permeabilization and fixation. The approach developed here, utilizing a small molecule affinity ligand, is compatible with live cells, can be used in vivo, and has potential clinical applicability. Not only does Ibrutinib-BFL specifically bind to BTK, but also it remains bound until protein turnover due to the virtually nonexistent off-rate of covalent inhibitors. This feature will allow for long-term study of endogenous BTK in live cells, providing a window into drug pharmacodynamics, as well as innate heterogeneity in responses to drugs targeting the BCR signaling pathway2427.
Beyond utilizing Ibrutinib-BFL in pharmacologic studies of next generation inhibitors, there are future diagnostic opportunities in which BTK-expressing lymphomas could be imaged in the clinic. While the current work focused on single cell imaging in vivo, we also anticipate whole body imaging applications. For example, the fluorine in BODIPY-FL could be exchanged for 18F for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, or entirely replaced via bioorthogonal ligands or direct 18F attachment36373839. Alternatively, longer-lived isotopes such as Zirconium-89 could also be utilized in order to take full advantage of the probe's irreversible binding kinetics4041424344. Such molecules may be useful in clinical imaging-based tests for whole body distribution and inhibition of BTK. Other areas of interest are to use these molecules for imaging BTK in macrophages during infection, or to use them as a readout during gene therapy for the immunodeficiency disorder X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which results from loss of functional BTK45. Irrespective of the contemplated use, we believe that the developed agent should be useful in a number of different applications. As covalent inhibitors have gained interest, we anticipate covalent imaging agents to follow, and Ibrutinib-BFL can provide a roadmap for such development.

Cell Lines
The diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines DB and Toledo were generously provided by Dr. Anthony Letai (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA). The RC-K8 DLBCL cell line was a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Gilmore (Boston University, Boston, MA, USA). Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma cell line and Jurkat T-cell leukemia line were from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Lymphoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37degC and 5% CO2. To test the BTK inhibitor in adherent cells, we used HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, which have previously been shown to be ideal for intravital imaging studies46. HT1080 cells were from ATCC, grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin at 37degC and 5% CO2. HT1080-BTK-mCherry cells were prepared by viral infection of HT1080 cells. Virus generated from pMSCVpuro-mCherry-BTK retroviral vector35 was a generous gift from Dr. Hidde Ploegh (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA). Viral supernatant was added directly to HT1080 cells for 48 hours, and BTK-mCherry-expressing cells were then selected with RPMI media containing 2 ug/mL puromycin for 96 hours. Following selection, HT1080-BTK-mCherry cells were cultured under the same conditions as the original HT1080 cells.
Gel Electrophoresis
To test the covalent binding of Ibrutinib-BFL to BTK, 0.1 ug (1 uL) purified BTK was combined with 0.4 uL Ibrutinib-BFL (prepared in advance in 2-fold dilutions ranging from 200 uM to 0.19 uM, 33% DMSO in PBS) and 18.6 uL PBS, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for one hour. In the second experiment, Toledo and Jurkat cells (2.2 x 106 per well in culture media) were incubated in growth media containing 5-fold serial dilutions of Ibrutinib-BFL ranging from 6 uM to 9.6 nM in final 2% DMSO at 37degC for two hours. Control samples were incubated in growth media containing 2% DMSO. Cells were washed once with ice cold PBS, then lysed in 150 uL 1X RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) containing protease inhibitors. To the purified enzyme samples or cell lysates, NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and NuPAGE reducing agent (Invitrogen) were added for final 25% and 10% concentrations, respectively, and samples were heated to 70degC for 10-12 minutes in a Mastercycler thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). 25 uL per lane was loaded into 12-well NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Using 10 uL of Novex Sharp Pre-stained Protein Standard (Invitrogen) as a size marker, the gels were run in NuPAGE MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) at 200 V for 35 minutes in the XCell SureLock Mini-Electrophoresis system (Invitrogen). The gels were removed from the cassette and imaged using a Typhoon 9410 fluorescence scanner (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) using 488 nm excitation and a 520 nm emission filter. To show total protein loading, gels were silver-stained using the Pierce Silver Stain for Mass Spectrometry kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
Imaging of non-adherent lymphoma cells by flow cytometry
Jurkat and Toledo cells were single- or triple-stained with the following, followed by washing: Ibrutinib-BFL (2 hours in growth media, 37degC), Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye (Invitrogen), or APC-conjugated anti-human-CD45 antibody (Clone HI30, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA)(both 30 minutes in PBS containing 2% BSA, 4degC). Stained cells were transferred to Clear-view Snap-Cap microtubes (Sigma-Aldich) for Amnis ImageStreamX Mark II imaging flow cytometry (Amnis Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA). Single-stained samples were used to create a compensation table, then 30,000 images from each triple-stained sample were collected using excitation lasers 405-nm, 488-nm, 592-nm, and bright-field excitation, and 430-550-nm (Ch7), 480-560-nm (Ch2), 640-745-nm (Ch11), and 430-480 (Ch1) emission filters. Representative images were manually selected from this data set.
Imaging of adherent cells by microscopy
HT1080-BTK-mCherry cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 20,000 cells per well and allowed to grow to confluence overnight. Cells were incubated in growth media containing 1 uM Ibrutinib in final 0.1% DMSO, or control 0.1% DMSO, at 37degC for 1.5 hours. Without washout, a 50x stock of Ibrutinib-BFL in 5% DMSO was added for a final concentration of 500 nM. Control wells contained equivalent DMSO without Ibrutinib-BFL. Cells were incubated for one hour at 37degC and then washed once with media for five minutes. The media was then replaced and cells were incubated overnight at 37degC. The live cells were subsequently imaged on the DeltaVision imaging system (Applied Precision, a GE Healthcare Company). Images were processed with Fiji software, an open-source version of ImageJ.
In vivo tumor imaging
Nu/nu mice were implanted with 2 x 106 HT1080-BTK-mCherry cells into a dorsal skinfold window chamber (APJ Trading Company, Ventura, CA, USA) according to established protocols47 and according with guidelines from the Institutional Subcommittee on Research Animal Care. Tumors were allowed to grow and vascularize for two weeks. 75 nmol Ibrutinib-BFL in 150 uL solution containing DMAc and solutol was injected via tail vein as reported previously48. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in 2 L/min oxygen. Time-lapse microscopy was performed for two hours using a customized Olympus FV1000 confocal/multiphoton microscope equipped with a 20x objective (both Olympus America, Chelmsford, MA, USA). In addition, tumors were imaged before injection, and at 2, 5, and 24 hours post-injection. Images were processed with Fiji software.
Histology
HT1080-BTK-mCherry tumors were harvested from nu/nu mice and embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA). Serial 6 mm-thick frozen sections were prepared for histological analysis. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry staining was performed using Mac-3 (clone: M3/84, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and BTK (clone: D3H5, Cell Signaling Technology), followed by Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (both Invitrogen) secondary antibodies, respectively. Images were captured using a BX63 fluorescence microscope (Olympus America) equipped with a Neo sCMOS camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, UK) and processed with Fiji software.
