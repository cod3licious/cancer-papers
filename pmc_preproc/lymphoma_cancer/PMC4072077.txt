Association of Chromosomal Translocation and
MiRNA Expression with The Pathogenesis
of Multiple Myeloma. Multiple myeloma (MM), is the second most common blood cancer after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Genetic changes, structural and numerical chromosome anomalies, are involved in pathogenesis of MM, and are among the most important prognostic factors of disease-associated patient survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small 19-22 nucleotide single-stranded RNAs involved in important cellular processes. Cytogenetic changes in plasma cells alter miRNA expression and function. MiRNAs act as tumor suppressors and oncogenes by affecting intracellular signaling pathways. MiRNA expression is associated with a specific genetic change and may assist with diagnosis and disease prognosis. This study aims to evaluate recent findings in MM-associated cytogenetic changes and their relationship with changes in the expression of miRNAs. We have determined that MM-associated cytogenetic changes are related to changes in the expression of miRNAs and CD markers (cluster of differentiation) are associated with disease survival. Information about these changes can be used for therapeutic purposes and disease prognosis.

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM), is a heterogeneous malignant
neoplasm that occurs in patients over 50 years
of age. This disease is the second most prevalent
blood cancer (10%) after non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
(1). MM is a result of genetic mutations or changes,
including chromosomal translocations, deletions and
duplications in plasma cells. These genetic changes
are structural (IgH translocation) and numerical variations
[numerical aberration of single chromosomes or
chromosomal regions (del 13q) or changes in ploidy]
(2). Cytogenetic changes are among the most important
prognostic factors in treatment of MM (3). MM
has a variable prognosis where survival ranges from
several months to more than ten years (4). Detection
of genetic alterations is not only important for prognosis
but can be used for both therapeutic purposes
and monitoring prognosis. In addition, altered expression
of microRNAs (miRNAs) in association
with different cytogenetic and genetic abnormalities
(5) can assist with diagnosis and disease prognosis.
Cytogenetic changes in MM are associated with disease
survival and changing patterns of miRNA and
CD markers, in which these changes may be exploited
for therapeutic and prognostic purposes (Table 1).
Chromosomal translocation associated with good
prognosis
Chromosomal translocation t(11;14)
The t(11;14) translocation is a structural genetic
abnormality found in MM with a prevalence of 16% (6). This translocation leads to juxtaposition of cyclin
D1 (CCND1) with the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH)
chain loci and increasing plasma cell proliferative activity
in the bone marrow (7). The t(11;14) translocation
has a good prognosis and longer overall survival
with better response to treatment (8). Recent studies
have recognized significant increases in CCND1 expression
as a favorable factor in this translocation (9).
There is a link between the t(11;14) translocation and
P53 deletions, but not with retinoblastoma (RB) deletions
(4). Bone disease is higher in the t(11;14) translocation
and hyperdiploid multiple myeloma (H-MM)
because of the lower invasion rate of monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
relative to MM with additional time for bone lesions
to develop (10). This translocation is associated with
CD117-, CD56- and CD20+ phenotype, in which the
last two markers are associated with immature plasma
cell morphology (11-13). CD56 [neural cell adhesion
molecule (NCAM)] marker is expressed in 62-82% of
plasma cells in MM patients and is involved in cell attachment
to cellular components of the bone marrow
microenvironment. Lack of CD56 expression is associated
with aggressive signs with a high incidence in
plasma cell leukemia (14-16). The phenotypic property
of CD56- is suggestive of an involvement in disease
progress, migration of myeloma cells out of the
bone marrow, presence of Bence Jones protein, and
may contribute to thrombocytopenia (17, 18). MGUS
plasma cells do not express CD56 marker, hence this
can be used to differentiate between them (19). The
t(11;14) translocation is associated with lymphoplasmacytoid
morphology and light chain lambda
myeloma (20-22). High prevalence of this translocation
has been reported in IgM, IgE and nonsecretory
MM (23). There is a high prevalence of focal bone
lesions in the patients who overexpress CCND1 (9).
Increased expressions of miR-361-3p, miR-30e and
miR-582-5p have been observed in the t(11;14) translocation.
The first two miRNAs target the PPP2R4
gene, the activation of IL-6 signaling, and result in
increased growth and survival of myeloma cells
(24). Expression of CD23 (Fc receptor for IgE) has
been suggested in association with an abnormality in
chromosome 11, including the t(11;14) translocation
(25). CD23 positive patients with t(11;14) translocation
have thrombocytopenia with lower overall survival
compared with CD23 negative patients (26).
Although the role of CD23 marker in plasma cell leukemia
with the t(11;14) translocation is not known,
it may be considered a reasonable therapeutic for a
novel target therapy (27).
Hyperdiploidy
H-MM, the most common form of myeloma, is
associated with trisomy in chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9,
11, 15, 19, and 21, and less commonly with primary
IgH translocations. H-MM is a numerical chromosomal
abnormality associated with a favorable
prognosis and better response to treatment (43, 44).
There is high platelet count and bone involvement
in H-MM patients, but the level of serum markers
of bone diseases such as bone alkaline phosphatase
(BAP), carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen
(ICTP), osteocalcin (OC), carboxy-terminal
propeptide of type I collagen (PICP) and tartrateresistant
acid phosphatase (TRAP) is similar to
non-H-MM patients. Chromosome 13 deletion is
not effective on overall survival (OS) and progression-
free survival (PFS) of H-MM patients (10).
Decreases in miRNA-24, -152 and -425 increase
the expression of CCND1, fibroblast growth factor
receptor 3 (FGFR3), transforming acidic coiledcoil-
containing protein 3 (TACC3) and masculoaponeurotic
fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B
(MAFB) genes in H-MM (45).
Chromosomal translocation t(6;14)
The t(6;14) translocation is present in 3% of MM
patients, involves the cyclin D3 pathway in myeloma,
and is associated with a good prognosis after
treatment (1, 34, 46). This translocation may lead
to juxtaposition of multiple myeloma oncogene 1/
interferon regulatory factor 4 (MUM1/IRF4) with
the IgH loci and deregulation of its expression
(47). This translocation has also been reported in
plasma cell leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
(48).
Chromosomal translocation associated with poor
prognosis
Chromosomal translocation t(4;14)
The t(4;14) translocation observed in 13-15% of
MM patients is associated with short survival and
poor response to chemotherapy (23, 49, 50). Chromosome
13 deletion is highly prevalent in this
translocation. This translocation can affect FGFR3
and multiple myeloma set domain (MMSET),
Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (WHSC1)
genes, which have been introduced as MM-associated
oncogenes, and have been involved in MGUS
conversion to MM (28, 29, 51). Increased expression
of FGFR3 and MMSET has been observed
in 70 and 100% of MM patients with the t(4;14)
translocation, respectively. MMSET is a surrogate
marker for this translocation, and can be used for
its detection (2, 52). No differences in survival
rates between MM patients with and without increased
FGFR3 level have been observed (53).
This translocation is associated with the IgA isotype,
increased expression of G-protein coupled
receptor 5D, and an immature morphology. Short
survival and poor prognosis are associated with
IgA isotype and G-protein coupled receptor 5D,
respectively (6, 22, 28, 30, 54). A strong relationship
has been found between the t(4;14) translocation
and RB deletions (79%) in the Gutierrez et
al. (4) study however the final result showed that
the presence of this translocation alone was a poor
prognostic factor and decreased survival and simultaneous
presence of RB deletions were not effective
on prognosis. Expression of an insulin-like
growth factor (IGF) receptor such as CD221 on
MM cells has been associated with poor prognosis
and short survival, which its high levels have
been observed with 14q32 translocations including
t(4;14) and t(14;16) (31). IGF-1 is considered a factor
for MM cell growth and survival due to increases in
expression of the CD221 marker. This factor increases
the activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a growth and
survival factor in MM, and plays an important role
in angiogenesis by stimulating secretion of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through the MEK/
ERK pathway in myeloma cells (52, 55-58). MiR-
126 has been recognized as a regulator of MMSET.
MMSET increases the proliferation of MM cells by
stimulating the expression of myelocytomatosis oncogene
(c-MYC) (59). Decreased expression of MiR-
146a and MiR-135b in t(4;14) translocation leads to
increases in expression of PELI2 and IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor
associated kinase) genes, which are involved in
the IL-1 signaling pathway, with an eventual increase
in expression of IL-6 and MM cell growth (60). High
levels of miR-99b and miR-125a-5p are also related
to this translocation. miR-125a-5p deregulates the
expression of BAK1 (Bcl-1 homologous antagonist/
killer), Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13) and ERBB2/3
(epidermal growth factor receptor; EGFR) genes (24,
61, 62).
Cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosome 13
This disorder mainly involves monosomy in chromosome 13, however 13 deletion and 13q
translocations are present in less than 15% of MM
patients. The characteristic feature of this abnormality
is short event-free survival (EFS), short OS,
rapid recurrence and resultant unfavorable prognosis
(63, 64). Chromosome 13 deletion or monosomy
13 is an adverse prognostic factor that occurs
in 30-50% of MM patients (35). Monosomy
13 plays a role in MGUS conversion to MM in
patients who have a previous MGUS history, and
usually occurs before IgH translocation (47, 65).
Previously, a respective 82 and 100% significant
association between t(4;14) and t(14;16) translocations
with chromosome 13 abnormalities was observed
(6). Although the chromosome 13 deletion
appeared to be associated with t(4;14), t(14;16),
t(14;20) translocations and del (17), it was not
recognized as an independent prognostic factor (1,
66, 67). Ploidy status had no effect on EFS and
OS rates in MM patients with this chromosomal
deletion and a 13q abnormality would not alter OS
in hyperdiploid and hypodiploid patients (67-69).
The presence of del (13q14) has been shown to be
a factor of poor response to treatment; myeloma
cells with this deletion have higher proliferative
capacity compared with cells without it (70). Perhaps
the presence of the RB gene on 13q chromosome
has caused a reduction in the RB level following
del13q and increased expression of IL-6 in
myeloma cells, which would result in higher invasiveness
of the disease (47, 36). However, this was
not observed in a study by Zojer et al. (70). RB
deletions are associated with bone disease, low hemoglobin
(Hb) levels, and has no effect on the outcome
of t(11;14), t(4;14) and t(14;16) translocations
(4). Higher free light chain levels have been
observed in MM patients with chromosome 13 deletion
compared with patients without such abnormalities
(20). Chromosome 13 deletion (13q) has
a higher incidence in CD33- positive and CD117-
negative patients associated with poor prognosis
(12, 37). CD117 marker (C-kit) is a transmembrane
glycoprotein member of the subclass III
receptor tyrosine kinase family. CD33 (myeloid
cell marker) is a 67 kDa glycoprotein member of
the sialo-adhesion molecule family, which is not
expressed in normal plasma cells. Serum levels
of b2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase
are higher in CD33- positive patients (71, 72).
The miR-16-1 and miR-15a genes are located
on chromosome 13 and are not expressed in a
chromosome 13 deletion. Increased expression
of these miRNAs will induce apoptosis, thus
they can be presumed to be tumor suppressors
(5, 73). Expressions of miR-18, miR-19 and
miR-20 in chromosome 13 deletions are higher
than in patients without the deletion. Expression
of miR-15a, miR-16-1 and miR-17-92 is
independent of chromosome 13 deletion, and
has been suggested to be associated with poor
prognosis (5, 74, 75). Chromosome 13 deletion
has been reported to be associated with decreased
expression of miR-221 (61).
Del 17p13
This deletion occurs in 11% of MM patients. It
inactivates P53 and has a poor prognosis for treatment.
There is a strong correlation between this
deletion and t(14;16) but not with t(4;14) translocation
(2, 32, 66). Lode et al. (76) have shown
that 37% of MM patients with del 17p had TP53
mutations, while none of the patients without this
deletion had this mutation, which supported the association
of del 17p with TP53 mutations. Xiong
et al. (38) have reported decreased expression of
TP53, an adverse prognostic factor, which can be
considered as a surrogate for detection of del17p.
However Chng et al. (28) found no significant
relationship for survival in MM patients with reduced
TP53 level compared to those without it.
This was not an independent prognostic factor (28,
69), hence there is a requirement for further studies
in this area. There is a relationship between
TP53 deletions and expression of P53 nuclear
protein with poor prognosis (77). Chang et al.
(39) have reported that all MM patients with nuclear
expression of P53 were also positive for
TP53 deletion; therefore, the nuclear expression
of P53 could be helpful to predict del17. Chen
et al. (78) stated that nuclear expression of P53
has been considered as a surrogate for del17p
in relapsed/refractory patients who receive lenalidomide
plus dexamethasone. Moreover, aberrant
expression of P53 also plays a role in the
development of extramedullary MM (17). There
is a similar incidence of del17p in H-MM and
non-H-MM (10). Although no clinical and laboratory
relationship with P53 deletions have been
found, del17p13 is characteristically related
with hypercalcemia, soft-tissue plasmacytomas
and a high level of sIL6-R (4, 32). Decreased expression of mir-192, mir-194 and mir-215 in
MM with increasing MDM2 (a Tp53 inhibitor)
results in increased oncogenic potential in myeloma
cells, and these miRNAs are presumed to
have a tumor suppressor effect (79).
Chromosome 1 abnormality
Chromosome 1 abnormality occurs in the form
of 1p deletion and 1q amplification (gain of 1q)
in 18 and 38% of MM patients with poor prognosis,
respectively (40). A gain of 1q increases the
expression of cyclin kinase subunit 1B (CKS1B)
which is associated with bone marrow plasmacytosis,
pathogenesis and disease progression as well
as del 13 and del P53 (42, 80). CKS1B amplification
along with high plasma cell labeling index
(PCLI) is a marker of MM proliferation and short
survival; thus far, there is a reported association
with t(4;14), del13 and MAF translocation, but no
association with t(11;14) (35, 81). 1p21 deletion
involves CDC14A deletion with a poor prognosis.
The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) is high in
these patients and has been reported to be associated
with t(4,14), del 17p and del 13q (40, 41). In addition
to CDC14A deletion, deletions of CDKN2C,
FAF1, MTF2, TMED5, FAM46C and VSP33 genes
on 1p have been observed and are associated with
a poor prognosis. CDKN2C homozygous deletion
increases proliferation and results in poor prognosis
(79, 82).
t(14;16)/t(14;20) translocation
The t(14;16) translocation occurs in 5% of MM
patients and is associated with poor prognosis and
reduced OS, leading to deregulation of the C-maf
proto-oncogene (1). The c-MYC is a basic zipper
transcription factor involved in numerous cellular
processes such as proliferation, differentiation and
production of IL-6. Increased expression of this
factor results in increasing growth and survival
of myeloma cells, their attachment to bone marrow
stromal cells, tumor formation and VEGF
secretion through targeting CCND1, integrin b7,
and CCR1 (chemokine receptor) genes. Recently,
disruption of the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase
(WWOX) gene has been reported. This
gene is located on chromosome 16, and has recently
been recognized as a new tumor suppressor (1,
32, 83-86). The t(14;16) translocation has a higher
prevalence in IgA myeloma and the level of free
light chain is high in IgH translocations, especially
in t(14;16) (20, 33). Upregulation of miR-1 and
miR-133a in connection with the t(14;16) translocation
has been reported; miR-1 gene deregulates
expression of TAGLN2, KLF4 and c-MET genes
(62). The t(14;20) translocation is associated with
poor prognosis and occurs in 0.9-1.5% of MM
cases, in which there is increased expression of the
MAFB oncogene (33, 34). MAFB is a member of
the basic/leucin zipper transcription factors and a
proto-oncogene product. Suzuki et al. (87) have
found that increased expression of MAFB and
other members of the above mentioned family in
myeloma cells increases the expression of ARK5
[AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related
protein kinase] leading to increased invasion of
myeloma cells through the IGF-1/AKT induced
cell invasion pathway. Expression of cyclin D2
(CCND2) is deregulated in patients who have the
t(14;16) and t(14;20) translocations (9). MiR-133b
expression is also increased in these translocations
(24).
Deregulation of miRNA expression in multiple
myeloma
MiRNAs are small, 19-22 nucleotide RNA molecules,
which regulate processes such as development,
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
in cells (88). Due to genetic changes in MM,
miRNA expression and function is altered. This
alteration has an important role in pathogenesis of
MM and may function as a tumor suppressor or
oncogene (Table 2) (89). Therefore, measurement
of miRNA expression may help in determining
disease prognosis (Fig 1). Increased expression of
miR-19a/b in MM cases has indicated the role of
these RNA molecules in activation of JAK/STAT
signaling and in expression of IL-6 during negative
regulation of SOCS1, which has been shown to be
important in MM pathogenesis as an oncogene
(90). Mir-21 is also controlled in MM through the
STAT pathway and has a role as an oncogene (90,
91). IL-6 causes the growth of myeloma cells in
the JAK/STAT pathway by increasing expression
of myeloid-cell-leukemia (Mcl-1). MiR-29b, as
a tumor suppressor, inhibits this pathway by decreasing
Mcl-1 and causes apoptosis by increasing
caspase 3 activity which is reduced in MM
(61, 92). MiR-15a/16 has anti-proliferative and
tumor suppressive roles by inhibiting CDC25A, cyclin D1/D2 and Bcl2. Decreased expression
of MiR-15a/16 in MM contributes to proliferation
and survival of MM cells with increasing activity
of the Notch, c-jun and TP53 pathways (5, 73, 93).
Increased expression of miR-17-92 is involved in
anti-apoptotic signaling by decreasing Bim (90). The
expression of this miRNA is significantly increased
in MM but not MGUS, indicating its possible role in
transformation of MGUS to MM and its suitability
as a marker for the diagnosis and treatment of MM
patients (88, 94, 95). Re-expression of miR-214 induces
the expression of P53, increases CDKN1A and
results in eventual apoptosis of MM cells by downregulating
PSMD10 (which encodes the oncoprotein
gankyrin) and ASF1B (a histone chaperone required
for DNA replication). Therefore, this miRNA also
has a tumor suppressor role (96). Mir-124-1 downregulates
CDK6 and decreases phosphorylation of
RB and acts as a tumor suppressor. Despite methylation
of this miRNA in MM cell lines, the methylation
has not been observed in bone marrow samples,
which indicates the lack of an important role for it
in pathogenesis and progression of MM (97). miR-
148a/181a/20a/221/625/99b overexpression has been
observed in MM patients, among which miR20a and
miR-148a are associated with decreased survival (61).
P53 induces the expression of miR-192, miR-194 and
miR-215 which are decreased in MM patients. Their
re-expression in MM cells decreases MDM2 and increases
P53 which inhibits cell growth. Hence they
can be considered tumor suppressors (98). MiR-34a is
the P53 target that causes apoptosis, indicating its tumor
suppressor role. This miRNA is not methylated in
normal blood cells, but it is hypermethylated in MM
cell lines (99). Decreased expression of miR-30b in
cultured plasma cells has caused its identification as a
tumor suppressor (91). Decreased expression of miRNA-
196b, 135b, -320, -20a, -19b,-19a,-15a increase
CCND2 expression. CCND2 is involved in regulation
of progression from G1 to the S phase of the cell
cycle, and has been known as a transcriptional target
for MAF protein (9, 60).
Fig 1
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) by targeting some signaling pathways
in myeloma cells. Oncogenic miRNAs are shown in blue and tumor suppressive miRNAs are shown in green. Expression of
361-3p/-30e, 19a/b and 17-92 miRNAs as oncogenes are increased in myeloma cells. The first two miRNAs respectively target
the PPP2R4 and SOCS1 genes and activate the IL-6 signaling pathway, eventually augmenting the growth of myeloma cells.
Expression of 17-92 miRNA in myeloma cells prevents their apoptosis by reduced expression of Bim. -15a/-16, -215-194-192,
-146a/-135b,-34a,-29b and -214 miRNAs have been identified as tumor suppressors in MM. Decreased level of -215-194-192,
-146a and -15a/-16 miRNA results in increased expression of MDM2, IRAK1/PELI2 and cyclin D1/D2, respectively, with increased
growth of myeloma cells as a result. Increased miRNA-214 can induce the expression of p53 and apoptosis of myeloma
cells by reducing the expression of PSMD10 and ASF1B. Expression of miRNA-29b and miRNA-34a are decreased in myeloma
cells; miRNA-29b causes apoptosis by reducing expression of Mcl-1 involved in the IL-6 pathway.

Discussion
Thus far, MM is an incurable disease. Patients
who undergo high dose chemotherapy or transplantation
survive for five years (100). MMassociated
genetic changes can be used not only
to determine the disease prognosis, but a proper
therapeutic approach based on mutation and cytogenetic
changes to increase patient survival.
This article has reviewed these genetic changes as
well as altered miRNA expression in disease prognosis.
For example, t(11;14), t(6;4) translocations
and H-MM have good prognosis whereas t(4;14),
del13, del17, and chromosome 1 abnormality
show shorter patient survival and poor prognosis.
Hypodiploid myeloma and 11q abnormalities
are other genetic variations associated with poor
prognosis in MM (101-103). Chang et al. (104)
have reported a higher incidence of these genetic
changes in plasma cell leukemia compared to
MM, where this condition may assist in determining
disease prognosis and treatment. Chiecchio et
al. (105) have also confirmed a higher incidence
of the t(11;14), t(14;16) translocations and del16q
in plasma cell leukemia (PCL), which may be involved
in different clinical symptoms of PCL and
MM. Genetic changes in MM result in altered expression
and function of miRNAs. These changes
are also present in other blood diseases, including
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). For example, low expression
of miR-15a/16 in AML and CLL is associated with
disease prognosis as well as patient survival (106).
Increased miR-363/-206/-155 and decreased miR-
9 are important prognostic markers in WM (107),
but their role in MM is unclear and need further
investigations. CD marker expression differs between
plasma cells and MM cells. For example,
CD200 is not normally expressed on plasma cells,
but its expression is associated with poor prognosis
and short post-treatment EFS. If the CD200
marker is not expressed, the patient will have better
EFS (108, 109). CD45 negative is a progressive
phenotype of MM. MM patients who have this
phenotype show characteristically shorter overall
survival compared to the CD45 positive phenotype
(110). The effect of IGF-1 is dependent upon the
expression of CD45 in MM cells, in which CD45
phosphatase inhibits the growth of MM cells by inhibiting
IGF-1 signaling. Therefore, lack of CD45
may lead to a higher capacity for cell growth and
survival (57).

Conclusion
Genetic alterations of plasma cells in MM
change the expression of such molecules as cyclins,
miRNAs and CD markers relative to normal
status, eventually augmenting the growth and survival
of myeloma cells in the bone marrow. Sufficient
information about the alterations in expression
of the mentioned molecules and determining
their relationship with genetic changes in MM can
contribute to diagnosis, prognosis, pathogenesis
and even treatment of this disease, for which further
studies are required.
