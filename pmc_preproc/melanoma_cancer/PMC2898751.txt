[Abstract, Methods, Mixed]

Human Melanoma Initiating Cells Express Neural Crest Nerve Growth Factor Receptor CD271. The question whether tumorigenic cancer stem cells exist in human melanomas has arisen recently1. Here we show that in melanomas, tumor stem cells (MTSC) can be isolated prospectively as a highly enriched CD271+ MTSC population using a process that maximizes viable cell transplantation1,6. In this study the tumors sampled were taken from a broad spectrum of sites and stages. High viability FACS isolated cells resuspended in a matrigel vehicle were implanted into T, B, and NK deficient Rag2-/- gc-/- mice (RG) mice. The CD271+ subset of cells was the tumor initiating population in 9/10 melanomas tested. Transplantation of isolated melanoma cells into engrafted human skin or bone in RG mice resulted in melanoma from CD271+ but not CD271- cells. We also showed that tumors transplanted by CD271+ patient cells were capable of metastasis in-vivo. Importantly, CD271+ melanoma cells lacked expression of TYR, MART and MAGE in 86%, 69% and 68% of melanoma patients respectively suggesting why T cell therapies directed at these antigens usually result in only temporary tumor shrinkage.

Methods Summary
Tumor tissues were digested into single cell suspension as previously described6, 7, 9. Tumor cell suspensions were stained with anti human CD271 antibodies directly conjugated to Biotin (557195 BD Pharmingen) or Alexa Fluor 647 (560326 BD Pharmingen) and a human lineage cocktail of Mabs directly or custom conjugated to pacific blue: anti-CD45 (4528 Invitrogen), CD2 (555324 BD Pharmingen), CD3 555329 BD Pharmingen), CD31 (303114 Biolegend); in case of xenografted tumors the following antibodies to mouse lineage markers were used: H2Kd (553565 BD PharMingen), CD45.2 (109820 Biolegend) and mTer119 (557915 BD PharMingen) directly conjugated to pacific blue or FITC. All antibodies were used in a 1:50 dilution except H2Kd (1:100) to allow separation of mouse cells. Propidium iodide was used to exclude nonviable cells. Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) under 20 psi with a 100-mm nozzle.
During FACS isolation of candidate MTSC populations we adopted the strategy of setting up negative and positive sort gates at least one log apart to prevent cross-contamination between negative and positive cell fractions that might occur when low expressing positive cells cannot be distinguished from negative cells with a high degree of probability. FACS-sorted tumor cells were counted in hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA) and graded numbers of cells were suspended in a volume of 50 ml of media containing 30% Standard Matrigel (354234 BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Suspension was then injected by 31-gauge insulin syringes (Becton Dickinson) intradermaly on the flank of B-, T- and NK cell deficient 4 to 8 weeks old RG mice anesthetized with isoflurane-O2.
Methods
Tumor specimens were provided by SU hospital after obtaining the informed consent. Experiments were conducted on Rag2-/gc- DKO mice in accordance with guidelines established by the SU Administrative Panels for Lab Animal Care.
Primary Tumor Implantation
RG mice were anesthetized with isoflurane-O2 and small pieces (<2 mm) of fresh tumor were implanted on both sides of the flank. The incision was sealed with surgical staple.
Tumor Digestion
Tumors were minced with a razor blade, and then placed in a solution of liberase blendzymes 2 and 4 (Roche) in Media 199 (Invitrogen) at 37degC for up to 3h to allow complete cell dissociation with pipetting every 30 min. Cells were filtered through 40mm nylon mesh, treated with LCK buffer to eliminate erythrocytes and washed twice with HBSS/2% Heat Inactivated Calf Serum (HICS). Cells were stained for flow cytometry or injected into mice as whole-tumor single-cell suspensions.
Analysis and Cell Separation by Flow Cytometry
The single-cell suspensions were washed in HBSS/2% HICS and counted and then resuspended in 100 ml per 106 cells of HBSS and incubated with 1 mg/ml Sandoglobin for 10 min. The suspensions were then washed with HBSS/2% HICS, resuspended in 100 ml per 106 cells of HBSS, and stained with antibodies. Anti-CD271 (biotin-, or Alexa Fluor647 -conjugated, BD Pharmingen), at a 1:50 dilution; lineage markers diluted at 1:50 anti-CD45, CD2, CD3, CD31 directly or custom conjugated to pacific blue were used to allow identification of contaminating nontumor cells from patient samples. Tumors that had been passaged in the mouse were incubated with anti-H2kd (diluted 1:100; BD Pharmingen) anti-mCD45.2 and mTer119. Antibodies were directly conjugated to Pacific Blue or FITC, Stained cells were washed and resuspended at 0.5 ml per 106 cells with Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide to allow exclusion of nonviable cells. Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) under 20 psi with a 100-mm nozzle.
Single-Cell Suspension Injections
FACS-sorted tumor cells were counted in hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA) and graded numbers of cells were suspended in a volume of 50 ml of media containing 30% standard Matrigel (354234 BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Suspension was then injected by 31-gauge insulin syringes (Becton Dickinson) intradermaly on the flank of B-, T- and NK cell deficient 4 to 8 weeks old RG mice anesthetized with isoflurane-O2.
Humanized Mice Models
Generation of RG mice with grafted human skin: briefly, full thickness human skin sample was obtained under signed consent from patients undergoing breast reduction, abdominoplasty or face lift. Adult mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 2L per minute. The dorsum of the mouse was shaved with an electric clipper and then treated with a depilatory agent to completely remove the hair. Following sterile prep, a rectangular area of approximately 1 - 1.5 cm by 1 - 1.5 cm of skin was resected leaving the panniculus carnosus intact. Human skin graft was sutured in place with 6-0 prolene and covered with a non-adhesive dry dressing. Mice are then allowed to recover from anesthesia in a warm chamber then housed individually in separate cages.
Generation of NSG mice with grafted human bone: briefly, human abortuses' bones were obtained from Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc. Adult mice are anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane. 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 2L per minute will be used. A small patch of fur is shaved, and a small (2mm) incision is made in the skin. A pair of blunt forceps is used to generate a small pocket underneath the skin and a small (5 mm) piece of aborted long bone is inserted into the pocket. The incision is then closed with a single wound clip. A 10 microliter volume of 2% Iidocaine:1/100000 epinephrine is applied to the wound site, which provides analgesic for a period of 2 hours. Mice are then allowed to recover from anesthesia in a warm chamber then housed individually in separated cage.
Tissue Immunofluorescence
A small piece of tumor specimen was kept aside and frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding media. Seven-micron sections were cut, fixed in ice-cold acetone for 4 min, and air-dried. Slides were then rinsed in PBS, and blocked in PBS with 1% BSA, 5% goat serum (for extracellular antigens) and 1% BSA, 5% goat serum and 0.01% triton-X100 (for intracellular antigens) for 30 min. Primary antibodies used: rat anti- human CD271 (27005 Abcam), Pan Melanoma cocktail (mixture of mouse anti- human Tyrosinase, -MART1 and -HMB-45 antibodies) (CM165B Biocare Medical) and -MAGE(C1-C2) a kind gift of Leonard Cohen Lab LICR New York Branch. Sections were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at +4degC, washed in PBS, followed by secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat AlexaFluor 594 and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (Molecular Probes)) incubation for 1h at RT. Slides were again washed, incubated with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 3 min, rinsed in PBS, and coverslipped with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Staining was analyzed under LeicaDM4000B microscope. Pictures were taken under 40x objective and scale bars are equal to 50um
Melanoma Tissue Array Immunostaining
Paraffin melanoma tissue array slides (US Biomax Inc) containing 80 1.5mm tissue cores from primary and metastatic melanoma patients were deparaffinized through three changes of xylene, incubating 10 min in each change. Slides were hydrated to water by dipping them 20-30 times in each of two changes of 100% ethanol, two changes of 95% ethanol, one of 80% ethanol, one of 70 % ethanol, and two changes of distilled water. Slides were placed in microwave, covered with 50mM TRIS/20mM EDTA pH 9.0 buffer and microwaved for 15 minutes. Slides were cooled for 30 minutes, rinsed in distilled water twice and once in PBS for 5 minutes. Three tissue array slides were stained each with the following antibody combination: CD271 (abcam ab3125 R5) 1:100 & TYR (novacastra #NCL-L-TYROS) 1:20; CD271 1:100 & Mart-1 (biocare #CM077) 1:400; CD271 1:100 & MAGE (abcam ab60049) 1:50 for 45 minutes at RT. Slides were washed for 15 minutes in PBS. The following fluorescent secondary antibodies at 1:100 were used to visualize each antigen: goat anti mouse IgG1_AF594 for CD271, goat anti mouse IgG2a_AF647 for TYR, goat anti rabbit_AF647 for MAGE, goat anti mouse IgG2b_AF647 for MART1. Slides were incubated in the dark for 45 minutes. Slides were washed for 15 minutes in PBS and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium containing DAPI (ProLong antifade reagent with DAPI, Invitrogen cat#P36935). Slides were scanned and photographed at 20X using Zeiss AxioImager motorized upright fluorescent microscope using appropriate filters for each fluorochrome.
