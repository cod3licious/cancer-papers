Naphthoquinones from Onosma paniculata Induce Cell-Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis
in Melanoma Cells. Activity-guided fractionation of a petroleum ether-soluble extract of the roots of Onosma paniculata, which has been shown to affect the cell cycle and to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells, led to the isolation of several shikonin derivatives, namely, b-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin (1), acetylshikonin (2), dimethylacrylshikonin (3), and a mixture of a-methylbutyrylshikonin and isovalerylshikonin (4+5). All compounds exhibited strong cytotoxicity against eight cancer cell lines and MRC-5 lung fibroblasts, with 3 found to possess the most potent cytotoxicity toward four melanoma cell lines (SBcl2, WM35, WM9, and WM164). Furthermore, 3 and the mixture of 4+5 were found to interfere with cell-cycle progression in these cell lines and led to an increasing number of cells in the subG1 region as well as to caspase-3/7 activation, indicating apoptotic cell death.

Results and Discussion
HPLC analysis of the active
petroleum ether-soluble extract pointed to several shikonin derivatives.17 Using preparative HPLC, seven fractions were
collected, from which fractions 2, 4, 6, and 7 gave b-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin
(1), acetylshikonin (2), dimethylacrylshikonin
(3), and a mixture of a-methylbutyrylshikonin (4) and isovalerylshikonin (5), respectively.
Since it has been demonstrated that biological activity
can be lost due to polymerization during isolation processes,4 the one-step isolation procedure used was a great
benefit in the present work. The isolates were identified using 1H and 13C NMR and CD spectroscopic measurements
(Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information) and by comparison with published data.12,18 Compounds 4+5 were obtained as a mixture
and could not be separated, but 1H and 13C NMR
data clearly revealed them to occur in a ratio of 2:1. The enantiomers
shikonin and alkannin give identical NMR spectra19 but vary in configuration at C-11. They are not capable
of being differentiated by optical rotation with a sodium lamp as
light source, but CD measurements may be used for this purpose. All
isolated compounds exhibited a positive Cotton effect and were identified
as shikonin derivatives.19,20 This is the first report
concerning the CD data of 1-3.
Subsequently, the compounds were evaluated for their
cytotoxic potential using eight human cancer cell lines and human
nontumorigenic
MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity was compared to vinblastine,
which was used as positive control (Table 1). All isolated compounds exhibited cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 600 nM to 70 mM. The most sensitive was
the CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line, showing up to 6-fold lower IC50 values than MRC-5 cells. The four melanoma cell lines (SBcl2,
WM35, WM9, and WM164) were isolated primarily from different stages
of melanoma progression.21 It has been
shown that numerous genetic mutations leading to altered cell signaling
are involved in the transformation from benign nevi to melanoma.22 These changes enable melanoma cells to escape
apoptosis and contribute to unrestricted cell proliferation. The effects
of 3 and the mixture of 4+5 regarding cell morphology, cell-cycle distribution, and apoptosis
induction were analyzed. Test compounds were freshly dissolved in
DMSO and used immediately since storage in DMSO led to a considerable
loss of activity. Compound 3 exhibited the lowest IC50 values toward melanoma cell lines, which is probably due
to the presence of an unsaturated carbonyl group in the side chain.
Morphological changes (Figure S3, Supporting Information) were observed after 24 h and continued up to 48 h. Cells exposed
to the IC50 concentrations of 3 or 4+5 exhibited less density and a more round shape phenotype
with fewer dendrites. It has been reported that shikonin induces apoptosis
in several cell lines23-25 and affects the cell cycle.24,26 However, compound 3 and 4+5 are less well investigated. Investigations of the cell-cycle distribution
revealed that 3 and 4+5 strongly
affected the amount of cells in the G1 phase and, accordingly, the
G2/M or S phase. For 3, it was found that there were
up to 50% fewer cells in the G1 phase and an increasing number of
cells in the S phase (SBcl2 and WM35) or G2/M phase (WM9 and WM164)
(Figure 1). In contrast to 3 and
also 4+5, shikonin led to an arrest in the
G1 phase in melanoma26 and bladder24 cancer cells, while cells in the G2/M phase
decreased, indicating a different mode of action. Additionally, cells
in the subG1 region (up to about 20%) increased after 24 h (up to ca. 20%), indicating
apoptotic cell death, which was confirmed using a CaspaseGlo 3/7 assay
(Figure 2). The results for cells exposed
to the IC50's of 4+5 were similar
(Figures S3-S5, Supporting Information).
Figure 1
Treatment of melanoma cells with 3 reduced cells in
the G1 phase and increased cells especially in the S-phase (SBcl2 (A) and WM35 (B)), and G2/M phase (WM9 (C) and WM164 (D)). Gray bars: Vehicle-treated
control cells. Colored bars: Cells exposed to 3 (IC50). The times shown represent the duration of treatment, n = 3, with mean values shown. Areas from the bottom to
the top: subG1 cells (black and purple), G1 phase cells (lower light
gray and blue), S phase cells (dark gray and turquoise), and G2/M
phase cells (upper light gray and green).
Figure 2
Caspase 3/7 activity measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7
assay. Caspase activity peaked after 24 h when cells were exposed
to the IC50 value of 3, indicating apoptotic
cell death.
In summary, it has been shown that roots of O. paniculata are a rich source of acetylshikonin (2), dimethylacrylshikonin (3), a-methylbutyrylshikonin
(4), and isovalerylshikonin (5). All of
these compounds exhibited cytotoxicity toward a panel of cancer cell
lines. For the melanoma cell lines used, the results indicated that 3 and the mixture of 4+5 affect
the cell cycle and induce apoptosis.

Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures
CD measurements were
recorded on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter, at 210-600 nm
in CHCl3. NMR spectra were recorded in chloroform-d1 (Eurisotop, Saint-Aubin Cedex, France) on
a Varian Unitylnova 400 MHz (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz
for 13C) or 600 MHz (600 MHz for 1H and 150
MHz for 13C) spectrometer at 25 degC using TMS as internal
standard. For analytical HPLC experiments, a LiChroCART RP18 column
(250 x 4 mm, 5 mm) and a Merck Hitachi system consisting
of an L-7100 pump, L-7200 autosampler, L-7455 diode array detector,
and a D-7000 interface were used. Preparative reversed-phase HPLC
was performed on a Varian R PrepStar SD-1 with Dynamax R solvent delivery
system and an absorbance detector model UV-1 using a VDSpher 100 RP18
column (250 x 25 mm, 10 mm). For both, the mobile phase
consisted of water (A) and ACN (B). The following gradient was used:
0-45
min, 70-100% B; 45-60 min, 100% B.
Plant Material
The dried roots of O. paniculata were purchased at a medicinal plant market in Kunming, China, in
November 2003. They were identified macroscopically by Prof. Xiao-Jiang
Hao, and the identity was confirmed based on its ITS and trnL-F regions
by Prof. Guenther Heubl as described previously.17 A voucher specimen is deposited at the herbarium of the
Institute for Plant Sciences, University of Graz, Austria.

Sample Preparation
The compounds were freshly dissolved
in DMSO, subsequently diluted with medium, and used immediately. Control
cells represent vehicle-treated cells (0.5% DMSO). The final DMSO
concentration did not affect the cells.
Cell Culture
Human CCRF-CEM leukemia and MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA), supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich),
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria),
100 units/mL penicillin (PAA), and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (PAA)
(1% penicillin/streptomycin). Human U251 glioblastoma and HCT 116
colon cancer cell lines were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified
Eagle medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Human SBcl2,
WM35, WM9, and WM164 melanoma cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium
with 2 mM l-glutamine, 2% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Human MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were grown in minimum essential medium
(MEM, Gibco, Invitrogen, Vienna, Austria) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells
were kept in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 degC
and passaged at 90% confluence. The cell cultures were periodically
checked for the presence of mycoplasma by PCR.
XTT Viability Assay
The XTT viability assay was performed
as described previously17 and in accordance
with the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany;
cell proliferation kit II (XTT), cat. no 11 465 015 001). In brief,
10 000 cells/well in the case of CCRF-CEM and MRC-5 cells and
5000 cells/wells for the other cell lines were seeded into 96-well
plates (100 mL, flat bottom) and treated with various concentrations
of 1-3 or 4+5 for 72 h. Adherent cell lines were grown overnight before the test
compounds were added. After 72 h, a freshly prepared XTT solution
(5
mL of XTT plus 100 mL of electron coupling reagent) was added
and analyzed after another 1.5 or 4 h (CCRF-CEM cells) using a Victor2 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences,
Waltham, MA, USA). Vinblastine served as positive control (0.01 mM).
Cell-Cycle Analysis
Cells were treated with the respective
IC50 concentration for 12-72 h and harvested by
trypsinization. Then, 5 x 105 cells were fixed with
70% ice-cold EtOH for 10 min at 4 degC. After washing with PBS,
the cell pellet was resuspended in propidium iodide (PI) staining
buffer (50 mL/mL
PI, RNase A, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) and incubated at 37
degC for 15 min. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) using Modfit
Software version 3.0 (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME, USA).
Caspase-Glo 3/7Assay
For this assay, 10 000
cells/well (100 mL) were treated with the respective test-compound
IC50 concentration for 6-72 h and analyzed for caspase
activation using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega Corporation, Madison,
WI, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence was
measured 30 min after adding the Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent (Caspase-Glo
substrate and buffer).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried
out using SigmaPlot 12.0 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
IC50 values were determined using the four-parameter logistic
curve, at least eight concentrations of the test compound, and two
different cell passages each tested in three independent wells. Results
are expressed as mean +- SEM.
