[Abstract, Methods, Methods, Mixed]

Tumor microenvironment induces innate RAF-inhibitor resistance through HGF secretion. Drug resistance remains a vexing problem in the treatment of cancer patients. While many studies have focused on cell autonomous mechanisms of drug resistance, we hypothesized that the tumor microenvironment may confer innate resistance to therapy. Here we developed a co-culture system to systematically assay the ability of 23 stromal cell types to influence the innate resistance of 45 cancer cell lines to 35 anti-cancer drugs. We found that stroma-mediated resistance is surprisingly common - particularly to targeted agents. We further characterized the stroma-mediated resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to RAF inhibition because most of these patients exhibit some degree of innate resistance1-4. Proteomic analysis showed that stromal secretion of the growth factor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) resulted in activation of the HGF receptor MET, reactivation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, and immediate resistance to RAF inhibition. Immunohistochemistry confirmed stromal HGF expression in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma and a statistically significant correlation between stromal HGF expression and innate resistance to treatment. Dual inhibition of RAF and MET resulted in reversal of drug resistance, suggesting RAF/MET combination therapy as a potential therapeutic strategy for BRAF-mutant melanoma. A similar resistance mechanism was uncovered in a subset of BRAF-mutant colorectal and glioblastoma cell lines. More generally, these studies indicate that the systematic dissection of tumor-microenvironment interactions may reveal important mechanisms underlying drug resistance.

METHODS SUMMARY
Stromal mediated chemoresistance co-culture screen
On day 0 stromal cells (1700 cells in 20ul/well) were plated in 384-clear bottom plates (Corning #3712), together with GFP-labeled cancer cells (1700 cells/20ul). Cells were treated on day 1 with 10 uL of 5X drug using the Cybi-Well Vario 384/25 (CyBio). On day 4, the media in all wells was replaced with fresh media and fresh drug was added to all wells containing melanoma cell lines (all other cancers were treated on day 1 only). GFP was read on Days 1, 4, and 7 by SpectraMax M5e microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence microscope with high throughput screening (HTS) capabilities (Zeiss Axio observer Z1) was used to document bright field and GFP images on day 7. All screens were done in quadruplicate. See Supplementary information for full methods description.

3. Clinical samples
Patients with metastatic melanoma containing BRAF V600E mutation (confirmed by genotyping) were enrolled on clinical trials for treatment with a BRAF inhibitor or combined BRAF + MEK inhibitors (Supplementary Table 7) and were consented for tissue acquisition per IRB-approved protocol. Tumor biopsies were performed pre-treatment (day 0), at 10-14 days on treatment, and at time of progression. Formalin-fixed tissue was analyzed to confirm that viable tumor was present via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Tumor responses were determined by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
4. Analysis of Co-culture screen data
The GFP readings from each well on day 7 were background subtracted by the readings in the same wells on day 1, and quadruplicates were averaged. The drug effect for each cancer cell line in the presence or absence of stromal cells was calculated by normalizing the number of cells (GFP) after 7 days of treatment to the number of cells (GFP) in DMSO control wells. The drug effect in the presence of stromal cells was further normalized to the effect that each stromal cell type has on cancer cell proliferation when no drug is present (See "Without Stroma" and "With Stroma" columns in Supplementary table 3). "Rescue score" was calculated by subtracting the "Without stroma" drug effect from the "With stroma" drug effect.
5. Analysis of Co-culture screen data
The GFP readings from each well on day 1 were subtracted from the readings in the same wells on day 7. Quadruplicates were averaged. The effect of each drug on the proliferation of each cancer cell line was calculated by normalizing the GFP reading of the cancer cell line when treated with a drug to the GFP reading of the same cancer cell line when treated with DMSO control ("No stroma" column in Supplementary table 3). The proliferation of the cancer cell under a drug when co-cultured with a stroma cell line was normalized first to the proliferation of the same cancer cell line when grown without drug or stromal cell line and then normalized again to the effect that the specific stromal cell line has on the proliferation of the cancer cell line ("With Stroma" column in Supplementary table 3). "Rescue score" was calculated by subtracting the "No stroma" drug effect from the "With stroma" drug effect.
6. Assigning "rescue by stroma" score to all screened drugs (Supplementary table 2)
Only cases in which a drug slowed the proliferation of a cancer cell line to <30% were analyzed (Supplementary table 4). Rescue was counted as positive if the rescue score was > 0.3. Drugs that were rescued by stromal cells in at least 3 different cancer cell lines representing >40% of all screened cancer cell lines for this drug got the maximal score: "++". Drugs that were rescued by stromal cells in 3 cancer cell lines that represent only 20-40% of screened cancer cell lines or that were rescued in only 1 or 2 cell lines that represent more than 40% of screened cancer cell lines were scored: "+".
7. Antibody arrays
Soluble proteins in the media of the stromal cell-lines were measured using RayBio Human cytokine array G4000 (#AAH-CYT-G4000-8) and RayBio Biotin Label-based Human Antibody Array (#AAH-BLG-1-4), according to recommended protocols. These arrays can detect 274 and 507 proteins, respectively. Stromal cells were plated 3 days before the experiment in DMEM containing 10% FBS and were 75-90% confluent when media was collected and filtered. Media with 10% FBS was also hybridized to the arrays and used later for normalization. 10 Technical and Biological replicates were done - both showing a very high correlation (Correlation coefficient > 0.9) (Data not shown). Hybridization was done overnight in 4degC. All slides were scanned using Axon's GenePix 4000B scanner and analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.0. The F532 Median - B532 score was used and averaged across triplicates on each array. Results were then normalized using internal controls and values of cytokines in clear media + 10% FBS were subtracted. All results are available in Supplementary tables 5 and 6.
8. Stromal averaged Melanoma rescue scores
The averaged melanoma rescue effect of each stromal cell line was calculated by averaging the rescue scores of this cell line (Supp. Table 3) across all melanoma cell lines and all PLX4720 concentrations. Only instances in which the treatment caused a drop of proliferation below 0.3 when no stromal cells are present were included in this calculation.
9. The effect of pre-conditioned media (PCM)
PCM was prepared by filtering media from 80-90% confluent 15cm plates that were plated 3 days earlier and then diluting it 1:1 with fresh media. Experiments were performed according to the previously described co-culture experiment protocol except for the following changes: 1. On day 0, 384-well plates were seeded with 20ul/well of PCM instead of 20ul of stromal cells. 2. On day 1, the media from all wells was changed to fresh PCM. 3. On day 4, media was changed to fresh PCM instead of fresh media before re-treating the cells.
10. Hierarchical clustering
Unsupervised Hierarchical clustering of stromal cell lines according to their ability to rescue melanoma cancer cell lines from 2uM of PLX4720 (Supp. Table 3) was done using GENE-E (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/). Euclidean distance metric was used.
11. HGF ELISA
Cells were plated 3 days before the experiment in DMEM containing 10% FBS and were 75-90% confluent when media was collected and filtered. HGF ELISA was performed using RayBio Human HGF ELISA kit (#ELH-HGF-001) according to the kit's instructions. The media was diluted 1:1 with diluents B before it was added to the assay microplate. For the standard HGF curve we used the same HGF that was used for all other experiments (#228-10702-2) and not the HGF that comes with the kit. Absorbance at 450nm was read using Spectramax M5e (Molecular Devices).
12. Neutralizing HGF by Anti-HGF antibodies
Co-culture experiments were performed as described above except for the addition of Neutralizing anti-HGF antibodies (R&D Systems #MAB294) on days 0 and on day 4 after the media was changed.
13. Western blot analysis and quantification
Cells were plated a day before treatment in a 6-well plate at 5x105 cells/well, and were treated the next day. At the designated time points, cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1mg/mL NaF, a one pellet per 10ml each of Roche PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor (04906837001) and Roche Complete Mini protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein concentrations were determined by BioRad DC Protein Assay Kit II. Samples were mixed with 4x protein sample loading buffer (Li-Cor #928-40004) and NuPage sample reducing agent (Invitrogen #NP0009), and run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel (NuPage #WG1402BOX) at 120V. Membranes were transferred using Program 4 on the iBlot Gel Transfer Device (Invitrogen #IB1001). Western blotting was performed with standard methods, with immunoblotting performed according to antibody manufacturer specifications. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence was detected with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor), and signal intensity was quantified with Odyssey Application Software (Licor). All quantifications were first normalized to background intensity, and then to GAPDH loading control.
14. High throughput westerns
High throughput western blot experiments (Fig 4a and Supp. Figure 17) were performed as described above, except for the following changes: 1) Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5x104 cells/well, 2) Samples were mixed with E-Page 4x loading buffer (Invitrogen #EPBUF-01) and run on 6% E-PAGE 96-well gels (Invitrogen #EP09606). For the transfer Program 3 of the iBlot Gel Transfer Device was used.
15. Rescue of melanoma cell lines by cytokines
One day prior to treatment, cancer cells were seeded in black, 384-well plates (Corning #3712) at a concentration of 2500 cells/well. On day 1, all 22 ligands were added at 5 different concentrations to 6 melanoma cell lines treated with PLX4720, PD184352, or DMSO control. On day 4, media was changed to fresh and cells were retreated with drugs and cytokines. GFP was read of the plates on Days 1, 4, and 7 by SpectraMax M5e microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
16. Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation profiling
Luminex immunosandwich assays were performed as previously described32 with the following modifications: Antibodies were conjugated to Luminex MagPlex microspheres (Luminex). Assays were carried out in 384-well ThermoMatrix square bottom plates (Thermo) in conjunction with a 96-well (CyBio) and a 384-well (BioMek) liquid handler. The data was acquired with a FlexMap 3D instrument (Luminex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The raw data was normalized by subtracting sample and antibody backgrounds.
17. Immunohistochemistry
Deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with Antigen Retrieval Citra Solution (Biogenex Laboratories, #HK086-9K) in microwave for 15 min. Tissue sections were then incubated with Peroxidase Blocking Reagent (15 min; DAKO #S2001) and Protein Block (15 min; DAKO #X0909). Primary antibody against HGF (R&D #AB-294-NA; 0.75 mg/mL), MET (Invitrogen #187366; 4 mg/mL), pERK (Cell Signaling #4376; 1:200 dilution) or pAKT (Cell Signaling #4060; 1:50 dilution) was applied, and slides were incubated for 16 h at 4 degrees. For HGF, sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-goat antibody (Vector #BA-5000) for 30 min. Signals were visualized using EnVision(tm)+/HRP, Rabbit (for HGF; DAKO, #K4003) or Mouse (for MET; DAKO, #K4001) or SignalStain(r) Boost IHC Detection Reagent (for pERK and pAKT; Cell Signaling #8114), diaminobenzidine (DAKO #K3468) and hematoxylin counterstain. To detect MET expression in melanoma, VECTOR VIP Peroxidase Substrate Kit (Vector #SK-4600) was used instead of diaminobenzidine. All Immunostained slides were scored by a pathologist (T.M.) blinded to the clinical outcome data.
18. Immunofluorescence
Fresh frozen tissue sections were stained using Cell Signaling Technology's general protocol. Sections were blocked using PBS with 5% normal goat serum (Cell Signaling # 5425S) and 0.3% Triton-X for 1 hour. Primary antibody against p-Met (Y1234/1235) (Cell signaling #3077S;1:100 dilution) diluted in PBS with 1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton-X was applied, and slides were incubated for 16 h at 4 degrees. Sections were then washed with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Dylight 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, #35552; 1:500 dilution) for 1 hour. Slides were mounted with Prolong anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies, CA, #P36935). Experiments were done in parallel with SignalSlide Phospho-Met (Tyr1234/1235) IHC control slide (Cell Signaling, #8118) for proper staining. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope.
19. Calculating excess over Bliss
The Bliss independence model predicts the combined response C for two single compounds with response A and B according to the relationship C = A + B - A * B, where A is the fractional inhibition of compound A at the particular concentration and B is the fractional inhibition of compound B at the particular concentration. According to this model, the excess above the predicted Bliss independence represents the synergistic effect of the combination treatment33.
