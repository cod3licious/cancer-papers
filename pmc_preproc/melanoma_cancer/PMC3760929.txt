Epidemiological and histopathological profile of cutaneous melanoma at a
center in northeastern Brazil from 2000 to 2010*. BACKGROUND  While representing only 3-4% of malignant skin tumors, cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive and lethal. Statistical knowledge about the biological behavior of this tumor is essential for guiding daily outpatient practice and aiding public health policies.    OBJECTIVES  To analyze the profile of patients with cutaneous melanoma attending a pathology department in Teresina (state of Piaui) between 2000 and 2010.    METHODS  Retrospective study of melanoma patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 in the Sao Marcos Hospital in the city of Teresina. The pathology laboratory reports were studied and all the statistical analyses performed using SPSS 19.0.    RESULTS  A total of 25 in situ, 199 invasive and 89 metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site were observed. Histological types found were nodular (52.8%), superficial spreading melanoma (18.6%), acral (10.6%) and lentigo maligna (9.5%). In 144 (73.4%) cases the Breslow thickness was >1 mm. Metastasis was found in 28.6% of invasive melanomas and nodular melanoma, Clark IV/ V, Breslow > 1 mm, mitotic index >= 6 and ulcerated lesions were more likely to metastasize.    CONCLUSION  Most melanomas presented Breslow> 1mm. The main factors associated with metastasis were nodular type, Clark IV / V, Breslow> 1mm, mitotic index >= 6 and ulcerated lesions.

INTRODUCTION
Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is an uncommon but often aggressive form of skin cancer owing to
its significant morbidity and high mortality rates. Although it accounts for less than
5% of all skin cancers, most deaths related to skin cancer are from melanoma.1The incidence of melanoma is increasing
rapidly. Brazil's National Cancer Institute (INCA), estimates that approximately 6,230
new cases of melanoma can be expected in 2012. Around 1392 people died of the disease in
Brazil in 2009.2
Since all the therapies normally used in advanced cases, such as chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, biochemical therapy and vaccines, seem to be incapable of providing cures
or improving survival rates, early diagnosis and therapy remain the main key to managing
melanoma.3,4A diagnosis of melanoma should be suspected in all
melanocytic lesions presenting changes in color, size or shape. The presence of
asymmetry of the lesion, irregular borders, colour variation and with a diameter over 6
mm are the ABCD diagnosis of melanoma and are indicative of biopsy for diagnostic
confirmation.5
The exact process that leads to the malignant transformation of melanocytes remains
uncertain, but among the possible etiological factors solar radiation, particularly
ultraviolet light (UV), is one of the more likely factors. It is believed that UV
radiation can cause direct damage to the DNA.1Since Teresina is a city located at latitude 5o south and 73% of
its population refer sun exposure without protection, skin cancer is without any doubt a
public health problem in our city.6
In south and southeast Brazil, with the highest estimated melanoma rates,
epidemiological studies on this neoplasm are now more common.1-5,7-19Epidemiological
data on the prevalence and clinical features of melanoma nevertheless are in short
supply in the northeast of the country. Considering the size of our country and the
ethnic characteristics of the Brazilian population, these types of studies are important
for better understanding the characteristics and behavior of this disease. Such an
approach could facilitate medical initiatives aimed at identifying cases, as well as
boosting relevant campaigns to draw attention to the disease of the healthcare community
and the population in general.11,14
The aim of present study was to analyze the epidemiological and histopathological data
of patients with cutaneous melanoma attending a reference pathology department service
in Teresina from 2000 to 2010 and to present statistical data that could be useful as a
basis for epidemiological studies and disease prevention in northeast Brazil. A further
aim was to identify the histopathological factors associated with melanoma
metastasis.

METHODS
A retrospective study was conducted of all patients who had had a histopathologic
diagnosis of melanoma in a pathology reference laboratory located in Teresina (Piaui),
Brazil, between January 2000 and December 2010.
The sample was non-probabilistic (convenience sample), comprising all patients with a
histopathologic diagnosis of melanoma during the period under study. Cutaneous melanoma
located in the mucosa or eyes, slides review, residual melanomas and relapse melanomas
were excluded. A total of 313 cases of metastatic or primary cutaneous melanoma were
assessed.
Data collected in protocol by the authors included patient characteristics (age, sex,
origin, tumor location) and melanoma morphology (histological type, stage of invasion
using Clark level and Breslow thickness, radial growth phase, vertical growth phase,
Mitotic index, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, regression, ulceration) and surgical
outcomes (clear surgical margins, analysis of sentinel lymph node and metastasis). Each
slide from the 11-year period was evaluated by one of four pathologists from our
dermatology service. To classify the subtype of melanoma, we used by World Health
Organization criteria.20
The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows, 19.0 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, Illinois). Descriptive statistics were reported for all variables. The
correlation between the categorical variables were studied with the Pearson chi-square
test or Fisher's exact test. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and we considered a
P value of less than 0.05 to be statistically significant.
Differences between means for continuous variables were evaluated by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test.
A logistic regression was also performed using as a dependent variable the presence of
metastases, and as independent variables gender, age group, site, histological type,
Breslow thickness, Clark level, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, mitotic index,
ulceration and histopathological regression. As association measure we used Odds Ratio
(OR), considering a confidence interval of 95% (95 CI).
This project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Sao Marcos Hospital,
in accordance with National Health Council Resolution No 196/96 guidelines.

RESULTS
A total of 313 patients were included in the analysis: 25 (7.9%) were in situ
cutaneous melanoma (CM), 199 (63.6%) were invasive CM and 89 (28.4%) were
metastatic CM. Concerning histological type in the invasive group, nodular melanoma was
found in 105 cases (52.8%), superficial spreading melanoma in 37 cases (18.6%),
acral-lentiginous melanoma in 21 cases (10.6%) and lentigo maligna melanoma in 19 cases
(9.5%). Other types of CM were found in 5 cases (2.5%) (Table 1). Graph 1 shows the
distribution of cases according to histological type per year.

2000-2010
The invasive CM group comprised 101 (50.8%) women and 97 (48.7%) men, a ratio of 1.04
women to men. Mean age was 70.1 +- 16.3 years. The majority of the patients were aged
over 50 (n = 167, 83.9%) and lived in rural areas of Piaui (n = 79, 39.7%) (Table 1).
With regard to the topography of lesions, these were located on the upper limbs (n = 22,
11.1%), lower limbs (n = 67, 33.7%), trunk (n = 62, 31.2%) and head and neck (n = 40,
20.1%) (Table 1). The women predominantly
presented tumors on the trunk (28.7%), lower limbs (27.7%) and head/neck (25.7%) while
the men had tumors mainly on their lower limbs (40.2%) and trunk (34.0%). These
differences were statistically significant (p = 0.038) (Table 1).
A total of 72.4% had a Breslow thickness of over 1 mm. The men presented more cases with
a higher Breslow thickness (78.4% versus 67.3% of women) and this difference was
statistically significant (p = 0.045) (Table 1).
The mean thickness of the primary tumors was 8.8 mm (95 CI = 7.3-10.5). Nodular melanoma
had the highest mean Breslow thickness (12.2 mm; 95 CI = 9.714.8), followed by
acral-lentiginous (8.9 mm; 95 CI = 6.211.8)), lentigo maligna (2.7 mm; 95 CI = 0.4-6.9)
and superficial spreading (1.4 mm; 95 CI = 1.0-1.8). This difference of the average
Breslow thickness was statistically significant with p <0.0001 (one-way ANOVA) (Graph 2).

** p < 0,001 (one-way Anova)
Among the patients identified with nodular melanoma, the mean age was 71.3 years and the
majority was Clark IV (46.3%) or Clark V (33.7%). Regarding acral lentiginous melanoma,
the mean age was 76.1 years and the Clark V was predominant (52.4%). Of those who had
lentigo maligna melanoma, the mean age was 65.1 years and the Clark level predominant
was II (76.5%). The superficial spreading melanoma group had a mean age of 65.3 years
and 48.6% were Clark III.
Of the total sample of invasive CM, there was a predominance of cases with Clark IV (n =
65, 32.7%) and V (n = 52, 26.1%) levels (Table
1). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, ulceration and histopathological regression
were found in 76.9%, 54.8% and 17.1% of the invasive tumors respectively. The mitotic
index was > 6 mitoses/HPF (high-power field) in 37.2%. This value was statistically
significantly higher (p = 0.011) in men (n = 45, 46.4%) than in women (n = 29, 28.7%)
(Table 1).
Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 19 cases (9.5% of invasive melanomas). In 9
of these (47.4%), frozen section examination was undertaken, showing compromised lymph
nodes by neoplasia in 4 cases (44.4%). The result of the histopathological study
revealed 13 cases (68.4%) free of cancer. There was no discrepancy between the results
of the frozen section procedures and histopathology.
Metastasis was observed in 28.6% (n = 57) of the patients with invasive CM (Table 2). Considering these 57 cases and 89 cases
of metastatic melanoma (a total of 146), the main sites of regional and distant
metastases were lymph nodes (78.1%), skin and subcutaneous areas (22.6%), lung (6.8%)
and liver (4.8%) (Table 3).
As shown in table 2, nodular melanoma (OR =
4.88; 95 CI =1.61-14.8), Clark IV (OR = 4.12, 95 CI = 1.2913.15), Clark V (OR = 5.79, 95
CI = 1.77-18.89), Breslow > 1 mm (OR = 11.1, 95 CI = 2.57-47.91), mitotic index >
6 (OR = 2.57, 95 CI = 1.33-4.98) and ulcerated lesions (OR = 2.41, 95 CI = 1.21-4.79)
were more likely to metastasize.

DISCUSSION
Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a serious threat to public health, and early diagnosis
currently remains the "best therapy" for this type of skin cancer. Unlike in the United
States where, according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
Program, the incidence of in situ CM has increased over the past 30
years due to increased attention paid by physicians and the general population to the
early diagnosis of CM, we observed a low rate of in situ CM (7.9%) in
our study.21This rate was also lower
than that found in other surveys performed in south and southeast Brazil, in which
in situ diagnosis is as high as 39% (Table 4).1,3-5,7-19
Brazilian studies tend to disagree regarding the predominant histological CM type.
Although superficial spreading melanoma is the main diagnosed histological CM type in
the majority of studies,1,3-5,7,8,13,16,19we found that majority
of cases involved nodular melanoma (52.8%), as shown in Porto Alegre (RS)10 and Sao Paulo (SP)9in the 1980s (36.6% and 19.8%
respectively) and Londrina (PR)11and
Brasilia (DF)14in the 1990s (41.1% and
45.0% respectively).
The predominance of nodular melanoma is alarming, since the nodular and acral
lentiginous histological types are generally associated with a worse prognosis - and
consequently a greater Breslow thickness.22We were able to identify nodular melanoma (12.18 mm) and
acral-lentiginous (8.95 mm) with a higher Breslow thickness mean than lentigo maligna
(2.74 mm) and superficial spreading (1.37 mm) (Graphic
2). In their evaluation of 496 cases Weber et al. also observed a
statistically significant difference between histological types lentigo maligna melanoma
and superficial spreading melanoma (mean 1.829 mm) and nodular and acral types (mean
5.035 mm).1
In the analysis of these results it is important to keep in mind that these data refer
to a pathology reference laboratory in a tertiary care hospital, where cases are likely
to have been diagnosed later rather than sooner and involving lesions already growing
vertically, thereby masking possible histopathological findings of other types of
melanoma.4
Late diagnosis was in fact the rule in our study: only 19.6% showed Breslow thickness
<1 mm, the lower nationwide rate (Table
4),1,3-5,7-19and the average
Breslow thickness was 8.57 mm. This is of major concern given that approximately 20% of
tumor patients presenting Breslow 1-4 mm have sentinel lymph node metastases, with this
value increasing to 34% among patients with an index of over 4mm.23
The identification of the early stages of cancer can reduce morbidity and mortality.
Three levels of prevention exist: primary, which prevents the occurrence of the disease;
secondary, which consists of early diagnosis through screening; and tertiary, which
prevents deformities, recurrence and death.6
Primary prevention of skin cancer focuses especially on sun protection, since the
relationship between elevated levels of exposure to ultraviolet light (UV) and a higher
incidence of skin cancer is well established in the literature. Studies have shown that
the damage caused by UV radiation, particularly on DNA, has a major role in the
development of melanoma, related to 65-90% of cases of tumor. The main target is usually
children, since they are exposed to up to three times more sunlight than adults and the
risk of cancer development is often related to cumulative exposure in childhood and
adolescence.14,24Secondary prevention is based on mass detection campaigns
to detect skin tumors at an earlier stage. In Brazil, the Sociedade Brasileira
de Dermatologia (SBD) has since 1999 run theNational Campaign to Prevent
Skin Cancer, involving dermatologists examining and informing the population of the
risks. Skin cancer screening programs can provide early diagnosis of melanoma in 90% of
cases, with a significant reduction of mortality.6,24Knowledge of CM
epidemiology is a vital component for both primary and secondary public health
strategies.3
We observed a gender balance (48.7% male vs. 50.8% female) and prevalence in people over
50 years (83.9%). Lasithiotakis et al linked men and older people with a worse prognosis
for melanoma.25Scoggins et al
indicated that the male gender not only had worse prognosis but also greater
incidence.26
Men presented a higher proportion of thicker Breslow (> 1 mm): 78.4% compared to
67.3% of women, which was statistically significant. At the Santa Casa Hospital in Sao
Paulo, women presented a greater proportion (60%) of thinner CM (up to 2.0 mm) and men
presented a greater proportion (74%) of thicker CM (> 2.0 mm).3Karakousis and Driscoll, in a study of 695
patients with primary melanoma, found 5-year survival rates of 75% for men versus 89%
for women, and also higher age and thicker lesions among male patients.27
In women melanomas are generally located in women on the extremities, especially the
lower limbs.4,19In our report, we identified a balanced distribution for
this gender: trunk (28.7%), lower limbs (27.7%) and head/neck (25.7%). Meanwhile men
usually have higher incidence of CM on the trunk (34.0%). According to our data, the
most affected site in men was the lower limbs (40.2%).23,28
Anatomical distribution of CM changes according to sun exposure of the population.
Distribution also changes with age. For example, melanomas in the chronically
sun-exposed areas (face, scalp and neck) are more common in the elderly than the
young.29Anatomic location of the
primary melanoma is an important independent predictor of sentinel lymph node status and
prognosis. Patients with primary melanomas of the head/neck and trunk usually have a
worse prognosis than primary melanomas in other anatomic locations.30
In 109 cases (54.8%) the presence of ulceration was revealed. This is one of the
independent factors associated with prognosis that is more consolidated in the
literature. It is believed that ulceration develops due to ischemia secondary to a
rapidly growing tumor, which suggests that it is associated with a worse
prognosis.22Balch et al., in a
study of 17,600 patients, demonstrated that tumor thickness and presence of ulceration
were the most significant predictors of survival, with a relative risk of 1.558
(1.473-1.647) and 1.901 (1.735-2.083), respectively.31
In our series, the high rate of ulceration was consistent with late diagnosis. In Sao
Paulo (SP), Florianopolis (SC) and Porto Alegre (RS), the ulceration rate was 35.1, 23.3
and 24.4% respectively.1,3,4As observed at other studies, women presented fewer ulcerated lesions
(51.5% in comparison to 58.8% of men, but no significant difference). It is possible
that women devote more attention to their own health and are more likely to seek
dermatological advice.3
In 74 cases (37.2%), the mitotic index was greater than or equal to 6 mitoses / HPF
(high-power field). This proportion was significant higher among men (46.4% as against
28.7% women). It is suggested that high mitotic index is also an important prognostic
factor. Azzola et al. investigated 3661 patients with cutaneous melanoma, finding that
patients with a mitotic index of 0 mitoses/mm2presented a 10-year survival rate of 95%, as compared with 80% in
patients with a mitotic index between 1 and 4 mitoses/mm2, 70% in those withan index of 5-10 mitoses/mm2and 60% in those with 11 or more
mitoses.32
Melanoma has the potential to metastasize through the lymph nodes to visceral organs.
Metastases most commonly first present at regional lymph nodes, but around one third of
them present directly at distant sites, with the lungs the main site.1Considering the 57 cases of invasive CM
which presented metastasis and the 89 cases of metastatic melanoma (a total of 146), the
main sites of regional and distant metastases were the lymph nodes (78.1%), skin and
subcutaneous areas (22.6%), lung (6.8%) and liver (4.8%) (Table 3). Lymph nodes, skin and subcutaneous lesions were also found
to be the most common sites by a Brazilian survey carried out in the city of
Florianopolis (state of Santa Catarina).1
Nodular melanoma (OR = 4.88; 95 CI =1.61-14.8), Clark IV (OR = 4.12, 95 CI =
1.29-13.15), Clark V (OR = 5.79, 95 CI = 1.77-18.89), Breslow > 1 mm (OR = 11.1, 95
CI = 2.57-47.91), mitotic index >= 6 (OR = 2.57, 95 CI = 1.33-4.98) and ulcerated
lesions (OR = 2.41, 95 CI = 1.214.79) were more likely to metastasize, representing
factors of worst prognosis (Table 2). These were
sadly the predominant features in our sample, revealing a history of late diagnosis and
poor prognosis in Teresina. (Table 1).
Melanoma may present clinically as a metastatic disease, without evidence of primary
cutaneous involvement. We observed 89 (28.4%) cases of melanoma of unknown primary site
in our series, marginally higher than the rate observed in Florianopolis (SC)
(20.2%).1Some theories have set
out to explain this phenomenon: the primary lesion removed surgically without
histopathological study of the material, the primary site cutaneous melanoma with
clinical appearance of benign lesion, the primary lesion located in the scalp,
gastrointestinal tract, adrenals, meninges, retina, palate, vulva, vagina, anorectal
area; primary lesion with spontaneous regression (hypochromic macula) due to
immunological phenomena.33 In our
study, we had to consider that this rate could well be an overestimate since all the
histopathological examinations were included, and in some cases the patient only took
the resected lesion for study and was not followed up in our dermatology department.
Over the past few years, with the use of PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography-Computed
Tomography), the incidence of melanoma of unknown primary site has tended to decrease.
PET-CT is widely used in oncology for lesion detection and characterization, as well as
for accurate lesion localization. Melanoma cells usually demonstrate a high uptake of
the glucose analog F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) - the finding that established the
rationale for the use of FDG in melanoma, allowing whole-body tumor detection and which
proved to be useful for detecting primary tumors.18,34,35Unfortunately the high cost of this test is a limiting
factor in Brazil.

CONCLUSION
The histopathological profile of melanoma in our study was the nodular histological
type, Breslow thickness> 1 mm, Clark level IV and V, with the presence of ulceration
and lymphocytic infiltrate in the tumor and high rates of metastasis. The main factors
associated with metastasis were of the nodular type, Clark IV / V, Breslow> 1mm,
mitotic index >= 6 and ulcerated lesions.
