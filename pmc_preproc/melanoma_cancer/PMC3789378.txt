[Abstract, Mixed, Mixed]

Recurrent mutations at codon 625 of the splicing factor SF3B1 in uveal melanoma. Uveal melanoma is the most common primary cancer of the eye and often results in fatal metastasis. Here, we describe mutations occurring exclusively at arginine-625 in splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) in low-grade uveal melanomas with good prognosis. Thus, uveal melanoma is among a small group of cancers associated with SF3B1 mutation, and these mutations denote a distinct molecular subset of uveal melanomas.
