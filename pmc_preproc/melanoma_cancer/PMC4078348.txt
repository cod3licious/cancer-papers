Pyrostegia venusta heptane extract containing saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons induces apoptosis on B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells and displays antitumor activity in vivo. Background: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker. Gawl.) Miers (Bignoniacea) is a medicinal plant from the Brazilian Cerrado used to treat leucoderma and common diseases of the respiratory system.   Objective: To investigate the antitumor activity of P.venusta extracts against melanoma.   Materials and Methods: The cytotoxic activity and tumor induced cell death of heptane extract (HE) from P. venusta flowers was evaluated against murine melanoma B16F10-Nex2 cells in vitro and in a syngeneic model in vivo.   Results: We found that HE induced apoptosis in melanoma cells by disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of reactive oxygen species and late apoptosis evidenced by plasma membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface and activation of caspase-2,-3,-8,-9. HE was also protective against singeneyc subcutaneous melanoma HE compounds were also able to induce cell cycle arrest at G2/M phases on tumor cells. On fractionation of HE in silica gel we isolated a cytotoxic fraction that contained a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons identified by 1H NMR and GC-MS analyses. Predominant species were octacosane (C28H58-36%) and triacontane (C30H62-13%), which individually showed significant cytotoxic activity against murine melanoma B16F10-Nex2 cells in vitro and a very promising antitumor protection against subcutaneous melanoma in vivo.   Conclusion: The results suggest that the components of the heptane extract, mainly octasane and triacontane, which showed antitumor properties in experimental melanoma upon regional administration, might also be therapeutic in human cancer, such as in the mostly epidermal and slowly invasive melanomas, such as acral lentiginous melanoma, as an adjuvant treatment to surgical excision.

INTRODUCTION
Malignant melanoma is a very aggressive form of skin cancer, with a mortality rate that has increased in 2% annually since 1960, making it a worldwide public health risk and the fastest growing of all cancer types.[1] Melanomas are usually removed by resection but are very difficult to cure in the metastatic form. Several strategies and combinations of anticancer drugs have been used in an effort to improve the therapeutic effect on malignant melanomas.[2] Solid tumor cells develop resistance to antineoplasic drugs and multidrug resistance is a major cause of chemotherapy failures of human cancer.[3]
Among skin cancers, the acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a variant occurring on volar surfaces of hands, feet, subungual site, fingers or toes and is characterized by slow lentiginous radial growth, with heavily pigmented tumor cells with diffuse reticular infiltration, lesions becoming unusually large, thick and ulcerated.[4] Acral melanoma poses a challenge to clinicians who must balance adequate oncologic resection with preservation of limb function.[5] In alternative to surgical intervention or to aid in the reduction of tumor size, the development of chemotherapy agents against this malignant melanoma is highly justified.
A frequently utilized syngeneic murine model of melanoma is that of B16F10 cell line in C57Bl/6 mice and the F10 subline, isolated by I.J.Fidler, is most invasive and virulent.[6] Therefore, it is chosen to monitor the in vitro and in vivo activity of anti-melanoma agents causing cell death or cytostatic effects. Cell death can occur by several mechanisms such as necrosis, autophagy, apoptosis, cornification and many other atypical cell death modalities.[7] Programmed cell death by apoptosis is a major natural barrier to cancer development.[8]
On testing new antitumor molecules, apoptosis is primarily looked for as a relevant cell toxicity pathway. An important function of apoptosis is to eliminate preneoplastic and neoplastic cells.[9] As opposed to necrosis, apoptosis progresses through a series of well-defined morphological and biochemical stages that occur in the nucleus as well as in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of the dying cell.[10] Apoptosis involves a series of biochemical events, including blebbing, cell shrinkage, mitochondria permeability, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation and fragmentation.[11] Added to these features, caspase proteolytic activity is a hallmark of apoptosis.[12] Cancer cells may adapt to the oncogenic signaling by disabling their senescence-or apoptosis-inducing pathways.[13] The induction of a pro-apoptotic therapy is therefore of interest because this mechanism of cell control is deregulated in tumor cells.[14] Unlike necrosis, apoptosis is a cell death process that results in the elimination of cellular debris without damage to tissues, because phagocytic cells engulf apoptotic cells without promoting tissue inflammation as observed in necrosis.[1516] Melanoma cells can be more resistant to apoptosis than other cancer cells.[17]
The use of natural products in cancer therapy showed that plants are a most important source of antitumor compounds, with new structures and mechanisms of action being discovered.[18] Several plant-derived products induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells but not in normal cells.[1920212223] Brazil has a vast territory with great plant diversity, since early times plants have been used to treat a large number of diseases including cancer. Many compounds with biological activity are obtained from Cerrado, Brazil's second largest bioma.[24] Several plant species from Cerrado are popularly used as herbal medicines for their reputed analgesic, anti-acid, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties.[25] The Experimental Oncology Unit routinely tests natural products for anti tumor activities mainly focusing on melanoma. Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl.) Miers (Bignoneaceae), a native plant from the Brazilian Cerrado, was selected by surveying different species from this biome based on their cytotoxic and antitumor potential in the experimental B16F10 melanoma model.
P.venusta is popularly known as St. John vine or flame vine.[26] This ornamental species exhibits medicinal properties. Its flowers are used in popular medicine for treating leucoderma, diarrhea, cough and diseases of the respiratory system such as bronchitis, influenza and common cold.[2728] In the present work we studied the cytotoxic effect of different extracts from P.venusta flowers. The crude extract showed a cytotoxic potential against melanoma cells with evidence of tumor cell apoptosis. Bioguided fractionation of a heptane extract (HE) that showed anti-tumor activity rather than a number of aqueous extracts yielded an active fraction (HEF2), which was cytotoxic in murine melanoma B16F10-Nex2 cells in vitro and in a syngeneic system in vivo. Analysis of active fraction using 1H NMR as well as GC-MS indicated the presence of a mixture of straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, with octacosane (C28H58) and triacontane (C30H62) as the predominant species. Individually, octacosane and triacontane were evaluated for their antitumor potential in vitro and in vivo and showed high cytotoxicity against murine melanoma B16F10-Nex2 cells besides inducing protection against a grafted subcutaneous melanoma. Both alkanes display a great potential as antitumor agents for topical use when the size and distribution of the tumor makes surgery a difficult procedure, as in many cases of acral lentiginous melanoma.

Plant material and extraction procedure
Flowers of Pyrostegia venusta (Miers) (Bignoniaceae) were collected at Patos de Minas county, Minas-MG (18o31'40.34"S e 46o32'19.75"W). The plant material was identified by MSc. Alice de Fatima Amaral and a voucher specimen was deposited in the Mandevilla Herbarium at the Centro Universitario de Patos de Minas (UNIPAM) under the number MGHM0430. The hydroalcoholic extract (HA) was obtained from 50g of powdered flowers macerated in 250mL of EtOH: H2O 7:3 (v/v) for 3 h at 60degC. Chloroform (CE) or heptane (HE) extracts were obtained from 20g of powdered flowers extracted three times with 200mL of heptane or chloroform with stirring for 2 h at room temperature. The extracts were filtered, dried under pressurized nitrogen and stored at-20degC. The dry extracts were reconstituted with 100% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a stock solution at a concentration of 10 mg/ml., Bioguided fractionation of crude heptane extract (HE).
Part of a crude heptane extract (HE) from flowers of P. venusta (600mg) was subjected to silica gel column chromatography eluted with hexane containing increasing amounts of ethyl acetate (up to 100%), to give 54 samples that were pooled into five fractions (HEF1-HEF7) after Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) analysis. The different fractions were tested for cytotoxicity using a murine melanoma (B16F10-Nex2) growth inhibition test. The cytotoxic potential of the heptane extract was detected only in the fraction pool HEF2 (12mg), therefore this was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy as well as GC-MS aiming at the identification of active compounds. The most abundant compounds found in HEF2, octacosane and triacontane were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity on tumor cells and were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (California, USA). Alkanes were diluted in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI-1640) with 0.1% n-hexane and 1% DMSO, vortexed and sonicated for 5 min for further incubation with 1 x 104 B16F10-Nex2 cells. Negative controls were performed with vehicle (0.1% n-hexane and 1% DMSO in RPMI-1640).
Nuclear magnetic resonance and GC-MS analysis
Silica gel (Merck 230-400 mesh) was used for column chromatography and silica gel 60 PF254 (Merck) for analytical (0.25mm) TLC. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at 200 MHz for 1H nucleus on a Bruker AC200 spectrometer, using CDCl3 as solvent and TMS (tetramethylsilane) as internal standard.
GC-MS analysis was performed at 70 eV in an INCOS 50 Finnigan-Mat-quadrupole spectrometer, using a capillary column (DB-5) coated with crosslinked methyl silicone gum (50m, 0.20mm i.d., film thickness 0.33mm). The temperature program was 100degC isothermal for 1 min, then 100-280degC at 10degC/min, and isothermal at 280degC for 20 min. The temperature of injection and detection were 250 and 280degC, respectively.

B16F10-Nex2 (3 x 105) cells were grown for 24 h in a 12-well plate and further incubated with 25 and 12mg/ml of HE or RPMI medium for 1 or 2 h at 37degC. The cells were harvested with cold PBS after three washes in the same buffer. Apoptotic cells were analyzed using the ApoScreen Annexin V-FITC kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Positive annexin V (AV) and propidium iodide cells were detected on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70) at 100X magnification.
Detection of caspase activity
The activity of caspases induced by HE was assessed using the ApoTarget(tm) Caspase Colorimetric Protease Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 x 107 B16F10-Nex2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with 50 mg/ml of HE for 18 h. Briefly, cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer for 10 min in ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 min, and 200 mg protein was incubated with 50 ml of the reaction buffer and 5 ml of the substrate, at 37degC for 2 h. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was quantified at 405 nm in a microplate reader (Spectramax M3, Molecular Devices).
N-acetylcysteine assay
B16F10-Nex2 cells (1 x 104) were seeded in 96-well plates for 6 h, pre-incubated with 10mM of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 2 h, washed twice in PBS and incubated with 50 mg/ml of HE for 18h at 37degC. In the control group, tumor cells were pre-incubated with RPMI. Cell viability was determined by Trypan blue (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) exclusion test.
Enhanced superoxide anion production
Enhanced superoxide anion production was detected by dihydroethidium (DHE) assay (Invitrogen) performed according to manufacturer's instructions. B16F10-Nex2 cells (5 x 104) were cultivated in 24-well plates and treated with 25 and 12 mg/ml of HE for 18 h. The cells were incubated with 5 mM DHE at 37degC for 30 min. For positive staining control, cells were treated with 5mM hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Negative controls were treated with RPMI medium. The conversion of DHE to ethidium by oxidation was observed by fluorescence microscopy with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70) at 20X magnification.
Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsm)
B16F10-Nex2 (1 x 105) cells were grown for 24 h in a 12-well plate and were incubated with 25 and 12 mg/ml HE at 37degC for 18 h. Cells were gently washed in PBS and loaded with 20nM of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Molecular Probes, OR) for 10 min at 37degC. Cells were immediately observed with the aid of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus I x 70) at 20X magnification.
Cell cycle analysis
B16F10-Nex2 (3 x 105) cells were incubated with 25 mg/ml of HE for 24 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS and pelleted at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. Cells were suspended and fixed in 2.5 ml ethanol (70% in PBS) for 15 min in ice. Cells were pelleted and suspended in 500 ml of PI solution in PBS (50 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1mg/ml RNase A and 0.05% Triton X-100) for 40 min at 4degC. Cells were pelleted and suspended in 500ml PBS for flow analysis on a Facs CantoII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed by Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc. Ashland, OR).
Peritumor treatment of subcutaneously grafted murine melanoma
Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice obtained from the Center for Development of Experimental Models (CEDEME), Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP) (average weight of 25-28g), were subcutaneously injected with 5 x 104 B16F10-Nex2 tumor cells. Peritumor injections were given starting 24 h after tumor cell graft. Treated groups (5 animals per group) received daily doses of 400mg of HE or 500mg of alkanes and the control groups received 5% DMSO in PBS (HE control) or 0.1% hexane, 5% DMSO in PBS (alkanes control). The use of 5% DMSO as vehicle was based on previous in vivo protocols described in the literature.[313233] Tumor size was measured daily for two weeks with a caliper, using the formula V = 0.52 x D12 x D2, where D1 and D2 are the short and long tumor diameters respectively, until the tumor volume reached a maximum of 3000mm3, when the animals were sacrificed. The guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee of Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP) were used for animal manipulation and experimental protocols (CEP 1234/2011).
Statistical analysis
All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicates. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The IC50 value and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and Instat Plus 3 (The University of Reading, United Kingdom). Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon Test was used for the in vivo statistics.

RESULTS
Cytotoxic effect of P.venusta extracts on murine melanoma cells
The P.venusta flower hydroalcoholic extract (HA) showed low cytotoxic effect on B16F10-Nex2 cells as indicated by IC50 values higher than 100 mg/ml [Table 1]. Hydrophobic extracts, either in chloroform (CE) or heptane (HE) were also evaluated, and the HE extract showed the strongest cytotoxic activity in B16F10-Nex2 cells, with IC50 value of 28.96 mg/ml, compared to CE with IC50 of 70.93 mg/ml [Table 1]. Positive control was carried out with doxorubicin [Table 1], a well known antitumor compound.[34] Nontumor cells 3T3, HF and Huvec were less affected by HE extract than B16F10-Nex2 cells [Figure 1].

Evidence of apoptosis
Morphological changes on B16F10-Nex2 cells were observed after cell incubation with 50 mg/ml of HE for 18 h. Cellular blebs, likely apoptotic bodies and shrinkage of the cytoplasm were seen [Figure 2a]. Analysis of the genomic integrity, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, was also examined as indicators of apoptosis.[7] Chromatin condensation was visualized in 30% of 1 x 104 B16F10-Nex2 cells treated with 50 mg/ml HE for 18 h and stained with Hoechst 33342 [Figure 2b].

Melanoma cells (5 x 104) were treated with 50 mg/ml of HE and 150 mM of combretastatin A4 as positive apoptotic control for 24 h, and DNA fragmentation was detected using a TUNEL assay (green fluorescence). DAPI (blue) were used for total cell nuclei (Scale bar: 20 mm)
Cleavage of chromosomal DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments was evaluated by electrophoresis gel of the tumor cell DNA extract after cell incubation with 50 mg/ml of HE for 24 h, and ladder fragmentation pattern was observed [Figure 2c]. Alternatively, the DNA fragmentation was assessed using TUNEL staining, resulting in 74% of TUNEL positive cells (green), compared to the negative control, which showed no TUNEL positive cells [Figure 2d].
Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface during apoptosis was also shown in HE treated cells as measured by the increased binding of Annexin V. After 18 h of cell incubation with 25 mg/ml of HE, 45% of the cells were at early apoptosis stage (Annexin +PI-) and 6% were at late apoptosis (Annexin +PI+), compared to the negative control. No primary necrosis (Annexin- PI+) was detected in treated cells [Figure 3a].

Treatment of B16F10-Nex2 cells with HE also rendered a significant increase in the activation of caspases 2, 3, 8 and 9 [Figure 3b], clearly defining the apoptotic response.
Enhanced superoxide anion production
Enhanced superoxide anion production in B16F10-Nex2 cells was observed after treatment with 12 and 25 mg/ml of HE for 18 h [Figure 4a]. About 60% of tumor cells treated with 25 mg/ml of HE showed enhanced superoxide anion production detected by dihydroethidium (DHE). In comparison, positive control cells incubated with 5mM of hydrogen peroxide for 30 min showed 65% DHE positive cells [Figure 4c]. Pre-incubation of B16F10-Nex2 cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) followed by incubation with HE increased cell viability by 30% (P = 0.013) compared to NAC-untreated cells [Figure 4d].

B16F10-Nex2 cells (104) were pretreated for 2 h with 10 mM NAC, washed and incubated with 50 mg/ml of HE at 37degC for 18 h
Inner mitochondrial membrane potential
B16F10-Nex2 cells were incubated with TMRE, a fluorescent probe used to measure DPsm in mitochondria. In resting conditions, mitochondria appeared as elongated structures regularly distributed in the cell cytoplasm. HE-treated cells showed a significant breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential measured by the decrease in 91.6 and 60% of TMRE fluorescence in cells treated with 25 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml HE, respectively, compared to untreated control cells [Figure 4b and c].
HE induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in tumor cells
Treatment of tumor cells with 25 mg/ml of HE for 18 h increased the percentage of cells in G2/M phase with a significant reduction of the S phase [Figure 5a]. Positive control was carried out with CA4. The cell cycle arrest induced by HE was accompanied by morphological changes in the cell volume [Figure 5b].

In vivo antitumor activity of HE
The antitumor protective effect of HE was evaluated in C57Bl/6 mice challenged subcutaneously with 5 x 104 B16F10-Nex2 cells. Daily doses of 400 mg of HE were injected in 100 ml of vehicle (5% DMSO in PBS) at peripheral sites to the original cell grafting. Treatment resulted in a significant decrease in tumor volume as seen from the 14th day of treatment with a potent antitumor effect of HE compared to the vehicle treated control [Figure 6]. In addition, no toxic effects, loss of weight, or alteration in animal behavior were observed during the treatment with HE.

Peritumor treatment started 24 h after tumor inoculation. HE (400 mg) in 100ml PBS was injected in daily doses and the tumor size was measured seven times a week with a caliper until the tumor volume reached a maximum of 3000 mm3, when animals were sacrificed. The control group was treated with PBS/DMSO 5%. *P <0.05
Bioguided fractionation of HE extract and chemical analysis
The crude HE extract was subjected to a bioguided fractionation procedure, in which seven pooled fractions (HEF1, HEF2, HEF3, HEF4, HEF5, HEF6 and HEF7) were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity on murine melanoma cells in vitro. The cytotoxic acitivity on B16F10-Nex2 cells was restricted to pooled fraction HEF2 with IC50 of 28.48 mg/ml [Figure 7]. Cytotoxicity of HEF2 was also observed against several other tumor cell lines, as shown in Table 2.
Figure 7

The 1H NMR spectrum of HEF2 (in CDCl3) depicted an intense singlet at d 1.18 ppm, a multiplet at d 1.51 ppm and a deformed triplet at d 0.81 ppm (J = 6.8 Hz) [Figure 8a]. These signals, associated to the absence of signals at range of d 5-6 ppm, characteristic of hydrogens linked at unsaturated sp2 carbons, suggested the predominance of long side chain saturated hydrocarbons.[3536] Analysis by GC-MS indicated that this fraction was composed by thirteen compounds [Table 3], which were identified as a mixture of hydrocarbons (71.18%): tetracosane (C24H50-6.92%), hexacosane (C26H54-7.23%), heptacosane (C27H56-2.72%), octacosane (C28H58-36.34%), nonacosane (C29H60-2.70%), triacontane (C30H62-12.72%), and dotriacontane (C32H66-2.55%) as well as by oxygenated derivatives in minor proportion (12.59%): 3-methyl-2-pentanone (1.13%), 3-methyl-3-pentanol (3.54%), 3-hexenol (0.83%), 4-methyl-2-pentanol (0.65%), allyl acetate (1.65%), 2,2-dimethylpentanal (4.79%). The characterization of these compounds was based on the comparison of recorded mass spectra with those available in the database as well as their retention times in a DB-5 column [Figure 8b], after co-injection of standards, as represented for octacosane [Figure 8c] and triacontane [Figure 8e].

In vitro cytotoxic activity of Octacosane and Triacontane
Since octacosane and triacontane were found in higher amounts in the HEF2 fraction, they were evaluated for cytotoxic activity on B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. Octacosane and triacontane were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (California, USA). Alkanes were incubated with 1 x 104 B16F10-Nex2 cells at different concentrations and we observed that both alkanes displayed strong cytotoxic activity on B16F10-Nex2 cells, with IC50 values of 20.9 mg/ml and 41.08 mg/ml for triacontane and octacosane, respectively [Figure 9a]. We also observed that both alkanes induced similar morphological changes as those induced by HE treatment in B16F10-Nex2 cells [Figure 9b].

In vivo antitumor activity of Octacosane and Triacontane
The antitumor activities of octacosane and triacontane were investigated in subcutaneous melanoma model. 5 x 104 B16F10-Nex2 Cells were injected subcutaneously in C57Bl/6 mice and daily doses of 500 mg of Octacosane and Triacontane were injected at peripheral sites in relation to the original cell grafting. Treatment procedure resulted in a significant delay of tumor progression with a significant antitumor effect of octacosane (P = 0.017) and triacontane (P = 0.04) compared to the vehicle control (5% DMSO in PBS) [Figure 6]. In addition, the survival rate of treated groups was significantly increased in triacontane (P = 0.018) and octacosane (P = 0.032) treated animals [Figure 10b]. No toxic effects, loss of weight, or alteration in animal behavior were observed during the treatment with octacosane and triacontane.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed that fractions and compounds in the heptanic extract of flowers from Pyrostegia venusta exhibit promising cytotoxic activity against malignant melanoma in vitro and in vivo, which enhances the therapeutic opportunities that this plant fits to be used in the treatment of different diseases.[37]
We show that murine melanoma cells react to the heptane extract of P. venusta by undergoing apoptosis. Hallmarks of apoptosis such as plasma membrane blebbing without lysis, cell shrinkage, mitochondria permeabilization, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine surface expression were observed during the treatment of murine melanoma cells with HE in vitro, confirming the apoptotic nature of cell death.[738]
Apoptosis can be variously induced, as by death receptor ligands interacting on the plasma membrane (receptor or extrinsic pathway) or by mitochondrial pathways (intrinsic pathway).[39] We suggest that the mechanism by which HE treated cells undergo apoptosis is related to the intrinsic pathway, as evidenced by the production of superoxide anions in the mitochondria of HE treated cells. Free radicals, particularly ROS, have been proposed as common mediators of apoptosis.[3840] Mitochondria are involved in the production of reactive oxygen species, mainly superoxides and hydrogen peroxide and mitochondrial membrane damage results in the leakage of superoxide anions into the cytosol.[41]
In eukaryotic cells, plant derived compounds can promote dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DPsm) resulting in leakage of pro-apoptotic factors mainly cytochrome c.[30] Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1 and then procaspase-9 (and possibly other proteins) to form the apoptosome. Heat-shock proteins play a role in the pathway to modulate apoptosis. Caspase-9 activates other downstream caspases such as caspase-3 that constitute the major caspase activity in apoptotic cells.[4243]
In a study with pyrimethamine in metastatic melanoma, this drug, which generates ROS, induced upstream caspase activation (caspase-8), bypassing CD95/Fas engagement.[44] Kim and colleagues also showed that N, N-dimethyl phytosphingosine could induce caspase-8-dependent cytochrome c release and apoptosis through ROS generation in human leukemia cells.[45] We observed that an apoptotic peptide (C7H2) inducing caspase 8 produced abundant superoxide anions in B16F10-Nex2 cells.[29] Other mechanisms by which ROS promote caspase-9 activation[46] have also been described. Oxidative modification of caspase-9 by ROS could mediate its interaction with Apaf-1, independently from the increased release of cytochrome c, and thus promote auto-cleavage and activation. Such mechanism may facilitate apoptosome formation and caspase-9 activation under oxidative stress conditions.[39]
We showed that HE treatment induced caspases 2, 3, 8 and 9, besides disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of superoxide anions. Caspase-2 activation could induce cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression.[47] It is unique among the caspases because it has features of both initiator and effector caspases.[48] Prasad and colleagues reported that ROS generation induce the activation of caspase-2 in human leukemic cells and the simultaneous activation of caspases 8 and 9. Cross-talk between these initiator caspases is mediated by the proapoptotic protein Bid.[49] It is possible that the HE induced activation of caspase-8 as mediated by ROS, and leading to apoptosis may involve the caspase-8-Bid-Bax pathway.
The antitumor activity of HE also involved the cell cycle arrest in over 40% treated cells. It is still unclear whether checkpoint genes are involved that could mediate mitochondrial apoptotic signaling,[50] or the expression and translocation of Bax.[51] Thus, specific studies of induced cell death signaling should be performed with the isolated active compounds from HE in order to better characterize their mechanism of action involved in the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
The cytotoxic potential of the heptane extract (HE) of P.venusta flowers on murine melanoma B16F10-Nex2 cells is related to the alkane rich active fraction, which is also active against several human cancer cells lines in vitro. HE was studied according to the criterion of the American National Cancer Institute, which states that the IC50 limit to consider a crude extract requiring further purification is 30 mg/ml.[52] Previous phytochemical studies on P. venusta flower extracts from India identified stigmasterol, b-sitosterol, b-amyrin and oleanolic acid compounds.[52] Recently, a complete characterization of phytochemicals occurring in the methanolic extract of P.venusta showed predominantly, myoinositol, hexadecanoic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, stigmasteryl tosylate, diazoprogesterone, arabipyranose. Moreover, these methanolic extracts showed antioxidant activity in vivo and in vitro, verified by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, although the compounds responsible for the antioxidant activity were not investigated.[5354]
In the present work, the active fraction HEF2 of the heptane extract of P.venusta flowers did not contain triterpenoids and/or steroids but rather, a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons in which triacontane and octacosane predominated. Previous works have shown that straight-chain saturated hydrocarbons have antitumor activities in different systems. Takahashi et al., (1995) have found that hentriacontane, the main component in their bioactive fraction, showed the highest antitumor activity.[55] This same compound predominates in the epicuticular wax in leaves from Kigelia pinnata, and is responsible for the plant protection against UV radiation and for its antitumour potential.[56] The saturated hydrocarbon gentriacontan (C31H64), present in the chloroform extract of Clinopodium vulgare, was reported to inhibit the growth of Erlich ascites tumor in mice, and also possesses antitumor activity against CEM and K-562 human leukemia cell lines in vitro.[57] Gomez-Flores et al., found that the observed antitumor activity against lymphoma cells was due primarily to the presence of hentriacontane in the leaves of C.vulgare.[58] More recently, it has been described that intracellular eicosanoid metabolites regulate mitochondrial function and induce apoptosis.[59] Recently, both octacosane and triacontane were found in the same proportions in a lipid fraction from the ether extract of Solanum elaeagnifolium as promising antibacterial agents.[60] Thus, the alkane rich HEF2 fraction from P. venusta flowers is in line with these studies, being responsible for the observed tumor apoptosis effects of HE.
Most importantly, mice treated with HE showed a marked reduction in the subcutaneous tumor progression indicating an important activity of this plant extract against primary melanoma, and the same antitumor activity in vivo was further confirmed when mice were treated with isolated octacosane and triacontane.
In this work, octacosane and triacontane had to be solubilized in low amounts of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to be tested, and probably their anti-tumor effect depends on the alkane-DMSO complex formed. It has been shown that in pure water, long chain n-alkane exhibits an intermittent oscillation between the collapsed and the extended coiled conformations. When the mole fraction of DMSO is 0.05, its concentration in the first hydration layer around the hydrocarbon of chain length 30 (n = 30) is of 17%. The formation of such hydrophobic environment around the hydrocarbon chain is the reason for the collapsed conformation gaining additional stability.[61] Such conformation of the alkane-DMSO combination allowed the observed antitumor activity of both octacosane and triacontane in vitro and in vivo, with no systemic toxicity observed in mice receiving DMSO alone.
Besides, DMSO presents great ability to penetrate tissues, which justifies its use in many therapeutical protocols in dermatology. It increases the effectiveness of the percutaneous penetration of many substances, facilitating their diffusion across the stratum corneum and promotes transport into the local blood vessels, as demonstrated by increasing the penetration of many agents, including 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of superficial tumors and warts.[62636465] Combination therapy of DMSO with different drugs enhances the healing of cutaneous diseases, such as acral lick dermatitis, arthritis, mastitis and scleroderma, and it is considered to have a low toxicity.[6667] The current use of DMSO regards its application in intravenous, subcutaneous and oral routes. Several recent works have presented DMSO as vehicle of different anticancer compounds administered systemically or topically in 1 ~ 10% solution.[68697071]

CONCLUSION
The Experimental Oncology Unit routinely tests natural products for anti tumor activities mainly focusing on melanoma. As pointed out before (Introduction) several plant-derived products induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells but not in normal cells. The nature of the anti tumor agents varies in terms of distribution, solubility and chemical composition. Surprisingly, heptane extracts but not aqueous extracts of Pyrostegia venusta were cytotoxic to melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo, and the active compounds are saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Since peritumor injections of the active alkanes protected against melanoma in a mouse model, suggestion has been made that these compounds might also be therapeutic in mostly epidermal and slowly invasive human melanomas, such as acral lentiginous melanoma, as an adjuvant treatment to surgical excision. Regional perfusion chemotherapy in addition to excision is significantly more efficient in the treatment of acral melanoma than excision alone.
