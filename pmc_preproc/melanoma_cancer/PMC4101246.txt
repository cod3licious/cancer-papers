[Abstract, Mixed, Mixed]

Follow-up in melanoma patients. Due to lack of evidence from prospective clinical trials, the diagnostic procedures, their frequency, as well as the length of the follow-up period in cutaneous melanoma patients should be based on the individual risk of disease recurrence, which is strongly dependent on the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. In the paper we propose the current recommendations for follow-up strategy. Nowadays, new effective treatment options with biological agents justify the closer monitoring of high risk melanoma patients.
