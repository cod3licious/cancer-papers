The deubiquitinase USP9X suppresses pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains a lethal malignancy despite tremendous progress in its molecular characterization. Indeed, PDA tumors harbor four signature somatic mutations1-4, and a plethora of lower frequency genetic events of uncertain significance5. Here, we used Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-mediated insertional mutagenesis6,7 in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal preneoplasia8 to identify genes that cooperate with oncogenic KrasG12D to accelerate tumorigenesis and promote progression. Our screen revealed new candidates and confirmed the importance of many genes and pathways previously implicated in human PDA. Interestingly, the most commonly mutated gene was the X-linked deubiquitinase Usp9x, which was inactivated in over 50% of the tumors. Although prior work had attributed a pro-survival role to USP9X in human neoplasia9, we found instead that loss of Usp9x enhances transformation and protects pancreatic cancer cells from anoikis. Clinically, low USP9X protein and mRNA expression in PDA correlates with poor survival following surgery, and USP9X levels are inversely associated with metastatic burden in advanced disease. Furthermore, chromatin modulation with trichostatin A or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine elevates USP9X expression in human PDA cell lines to suggest a clinical approach for certain patients. The conditional deletion of Usp9x cooperated with KrasG12D to rapidly accelerate pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, validating their genetic interaction. Therefore, we propose USP9X as a major new tumor suppressor gene with prognostic and therapeutic relevance in PDA.

Methods Summary
KrasLSL-G12D(K)24, Pdx1-Cre8 (C), T2/Onc6 (T), CAGGS-SB106 (SB10) and Rosa26-LSL-SB13 (SB13) strains were interbred to generate KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-Cre (KC), KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-Cre; T2/Onc; CAGGS-SB10 (KCTSB10) and KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx-1-Cre; T2/Onc; Rosa26-LSL-SB13 (KCTSB13) compound mutant mice. Non-quadruple mutant mice represented the comparison cohorts. KrasLSL-G12D and Pdx1-Cre mice were interbred with Usp9xfl mice to generate the KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-Cre; Usp9xfl/+ and KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-Cre; Usp9xfl/y (KCU) compound mutant mice, as well as the two control cohorts Pdx1-cre; Usp9xfl/y (CU) and KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-cre (KC). Usp9xfl mice were generated by Ozgene Pty. Ltd (Bentley, Australia). Mice were maintained in compliance with the UK home office regulations. Splinkerette PCRs were performed as described previously25,26. Reads from sequenced tumors were mapped to the mouse genome assembly NCBI m37 and merged together to identify SB insertion sites, as previously described25. Redundant sequences, as well as insertions in the En2 gene and in the T2/Onc donor concatemer resident chromosome (chromosome 1), were removed. Mouse survival curves and cell culture experiments were analyzed with the GraphPad prism program. The IHC histoscoring from the TMA samples and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed with SPSS18, and the Spearman-Rho correlation coefficient (2-sided) between USP9X and ITCH was calculated. The IHC USP9X histoscore and analysis was conducted using the Fishers Exact Test on post-mortem samples. The GEO accession number for the ICGC-APGI gene expression data is GSE36924.

Methods
Generation of Rosa26-LSL-SB13 knockin mice
TL1 ES cells27 were electroporated with linearized pRosa26-LSL-SA-SB13-BGHpolyA targeting construct and correctly targeted puromycin-resistant clones were identified by Southern blot. Two positives clones exhibiting a normal karyotype were used to generate chimeric mice by microinjection into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Germline transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA from the agouti offspring.
T2/Onc excision PCR
Genomic DNAs were obtained from Pdx1-cre; T2/Onc; Rosa26-LSL-SB13 (CTSB13) and T2/Onc; Rosa26-LSL-SB13 (TSB13) mice and primers used to assess the excision of the T2/Onc concatemer in the CTSB13 mice were: 5'-TGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTA-3' and 5'-ACCATGATTACGCCAAGC-3'.
CIS analysis
For the statistical analysis, 90,007 non-redundant insertion sites (Supplementary Table 3) were used to identify CISs using a Gaussian Kernel Convolution framework (GKC)28. An enhanced version of the framework was developed for SB screens to account for the local density of TA sites within the genome25. For example, a genomic region containing a large number of insertion sites but a low density of TA sites is considered to be significant and thereby identified as a candidate CIS. Conversely, a region with a large number of insertion sites but also containing a high density of TA sites is determined to be less significant, since the transposons have more "target" sites into which they can integrate. Multiple kernel scales were employed in the GKC framework (widths of 15K, 30K, 50K, 75K, 120K and 240K nucleotides). CISs predicted across multiple scales and overlapping in their genomic locations were clustered together, such that the CIS with the smallest genomic "footprint" was reported as the representative CIS. For highly significant CISs with narrow spatial distributions of insertion sites, the 15K kernel is typically the scale on which CISs are identified. Additional statistical analysis of insertion sites was performed using a Monte Carlo framework10. CISs were compared to previously published datasets of human pancreatic cancer genetics5,29,30.
Detection of Usp9x-T2/Onc fusion mRNA by RT-PCR in SB tumors
Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen SB tumors using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR was carried out with a nested PCR approach using primers of mouse Usp9x exon 1 and the Carp-b-Actin splice acceptor sequence of the T2/Onc transposon cassette. cDNA was used as a template in a first round of PCR using specific primers corresponding to exon 1 of Usp9x (5-gagtctgcgctgccgctgctg-3') and Carp-b-Actin splice acceptor sequence (5'-cataccggctacgttgctaa-3'). The product of this reaction was used as a template in a second round of nested PCR using an internal primer in the Usp9x exon 1 (5'-gctgccgctgctgttgctgc-3') and a second primer in the Carp-b-Actin splice acceptor sequence (5'-acgttgctaacaaccagtgc-3'). PCR products were cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and positives clones sequenced.
Plasmids, shRNAs and transfections
pSuperRetro-PURO retroviral vector (Oligoengine) expressed a short hairpin against mouse and human USP9x (5'-gatgaggaacctgcatttc-3'), mouse Itch (5'-gacctgagaagacgtttgt-3')31, and a scramble sequence (5'-gcgcgctttgtaggattcg-3'). pBabe-zeo-Ecotropic Receptor (ecoR) was obtained from Addgene (plasmid#10687). Myc-mItch cDNA was released from pCINeo-myc-Itch (Addgene plasmid#11427), and was subcloned in the retroviral vector pBabe-neo (Addgene plasmid#1767). KCU1 and KCU2 cell lines were transfected with pEF-DEST51-mUsp9x(WT)-V5 and pEF-DEST51-mUsp9x(C1566S)-V5 plasmids32,33. The plasmid pEF/GW-51/LacZ (Invitrogen) was used as control. Transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 hours later, cells were selected with 5 mg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen).
Cell culture
Tumor pancreatic cancer cell lines were established from KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx1-cre (T4878 and T9394), KrasLSL-G12D; P48-cre (TB1572) and KrasLSL-G12D; Pdx-1-Cre; Usp9xfl (KCU1 and KCU2) mice as described previously34. Cells were subsequently cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone). The normal human pancreatic ductal cell line HPDE was generously provided by Dr. Tsao and cultured as described previously35,36. The human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC1 (CRL-1682) and BxPC3 (CRL-1687) were acquired from ATCC and cultured according to instructions. The other cell lines were obtained from Clare Hall Laboratories (CRUK). The human cell lines Panc1, MiaPaCa2, 818.4, Hs766T, PATU2, SUIT2, FA6 and MDA-Panc3 (PDA); CaCO2 and SW1116 (colorectal cancer); SKBR3 (breast cancer) and A549 (lung cancer) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The human cell lines U937 (histiocytic lymphoma); RAMOS (Burkitt's lymphoma); NCI-H2179 (lung cancer) and ZR75-1 (breast cancer) were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were treated with 1 mM trichostatin A (Sigma) for 24 hours or with 5 mM 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Sigma) for 96 hours where indicated to obtain RNA and protein lysates to assess USP9x expression. For anchorage-independent growth assay, cells were treated with 5 mM 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Sigma).
Retroviral infections
Phoenix cells were plated 24 hr before transfection using the ProFection Mammalian Transfection System Calcium Phosphate (Promega). Target cells were infected with retroviruses produced in the Phoenix packaging cells (24 and 48 hr after transfection) in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma) and were selected with 2 mg/ml puromycin (Sigma) or 1 mg/ml G418 (Clontech). Experiments were performed using at least 2 independent cell line infected pools. Human PDA cells lines Panc1, SUIT2 and PATU2 infected with retroviral vectors expressed the Ecotropic Receptor (ecoR).
Transformation, Anoikis and EMT assays
Cell lines (1.5x104 cells) were plated in triplicate in 12-well plates and counted as indicated using a Z2 Coulter (Beckman). Cells were fed every other day. Anchorage-independent growth assay was assessed by colony formation in soft agar. Briefly, 15,000 cells were plated in duplicates in DMEM with 15% serum and 0.34% low-melting point agarose (LMP, BioGene) onto 6-cm dishes coated with 0.5% LMP. Cells were fed twice a week and grown for 2 weeks. For the anoikis assay, 105 cells/0.5 ml were plated in 24 well ultra low cluster plates (Costar) to allow them to grow in suspension for 4 days. Cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS and protein lysates were obtained. Cell line T4878 was cultured in matrigel as previously described37, plating 1000 cells/well. Cells were fed every 2 days and grown for 4 days. Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) was determined by plating 105 cells/6 well plates for 24 hr to allow attachment, followed by treatment with human TGF-b1 (5 ng/ml) (RD Systems) for 24 hr. p21 induction was assessed after treatment with human TGF-b1 (5 ng/ml) (RD Systems) for 2 hr.
Real-time PCR
Total RNA from human PDA cell lines was extracted using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). Human USP9x expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR (q-PCR) using TaqMan gene expressiom assays Hs00245009_m1 (Applied Biosystems) on a 7900HT Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was normalized to human b-ACTIN expression, assessed with the gene expression assays Hs99999903_m1 (Applied Biosystems), and shown relative to control samples.
Western blot analysis
Cells were washed three times in cold PBS and lysed with boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS; 10mM, pH 7.5 Tris; 50mM NaF; 1mM Na3VO4). Lysates were boiled 5 minutes, passed through a 26 gauge needle to shear genomic DNA and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 rpm. Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved in 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), transferred to Immobilon-P Transfer Membranes (Millipore), and incubated with the corresponding antibodies including anti-Ask1 (NB110-55482, Novus Biologicals); anti-Mcl1 (5453, Cell Signaling); anti-Usp9x (A301-351A, Bethyl); anti-CC3 (9664, Cell Signaling); anti-Itch (611198, BD); anti-p21 (sc-6246, Santa Cruz); anti-Smad4 (sc-7966, Santa Cruz); anti-myc tag (2276, Cell Signaling); anti V5 tag (R960-25, Invitrogen); anti-c-FLIP (ALX-804-127, Enzo Life Sciences); anti-c-Jun (9165, Cell Signalling); anti-p63 (Ab110038, Abcam); anti a-Tubulin (T6074, Sigma) and anti-Actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reactive bands were visualized with ECL plus reagent (Amersham). Relative expression was quantified with Image Quant TL software (GE Healthcare)
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) mouse tissues were cut into 3-mm tissue sections, and antigen retrieval was performed in 10mM, pH 6.0 citric acid (for Usp9x and E-cadherin) or 10mM, pH 8.0 EDTA (for Smad4). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched in 3% H2O2/PBS for 20 minutes. Signal detection for immunohistochemistry was accomplished with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using the Elite Vectastain ABC kit and peroxidase substrate DAB kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Primary antibodies used were anti-Usp9x, 1:200 (A301-351A, Bethyl); E-cadherin, 1:200 (610182, BD) and anti-Smad4, 1:100 (sc-7966, Santa Cruz). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Clinical patient samples immunohistochemistry and analysis
Tissue microarrays (n=404) were prepared from patient samples obtained after appropriate informed consent in Dresden (Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Dresden), Regensburg (Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Regensburg) and Jena (Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Jena). Informed consent was obtained for each patient, following review by the human ethics committee Ethikkommission an der Technischen Universitat Dresden The PDA tumor samples were collected from 1993-2009, and the majority of the patients (65%) did not undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. Those that did undergo adjuvant therapy (35%) were chiefly treated with 5FU or gemcitabine-based regimens, but in this subgroup there was no significant increase in patient survival. The median survival times of patients following surgery from each center were indistinguishable. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 mm sections that were prepared using silanized slides (Menzel Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany). Staining was performed with the Benchmark System (Ventana, Illkirch, France), using rabbit anti-USP9X antibody, 1:200 (A301-351A, Bethyl) and anti-ITCH, 1:200 (611198, BD); and the protocol UltraView HRP, with the CC1 modified protocol as pretreatment. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Staining intensities were scored as absent (0), weak (1), medium (2) and strong (3). For further analysis the staining intensities were grouped as negative (0) and positive (1-3). The Cox regression model assumption of proportional hazard was tested using a plot of the cumulative hazards function.
A second cohort of patient samples was obtained from the Gastrointestinal Cancer Rapid Medical Donation Program in the Department of Pathology at Johns Hopkins Hospital, USA. Use of all human tissue samples from resection specimens and autopsy participants was approved by Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board, and obtained after informed consent. All samples were collected within 12 hours postmortem and formalin fixed before paraffin embedding. 5 mm sections were cut from matched primary and metastasis samples onto glass slides. Slides were first incubated in Dako Target Retrieval Solution for antigen retrieval. Slides were then incubated with rabbit anti-USP9X antibody, 1:1000 (ab26334, Abcam) or 1:200 (NBP1-48321, Novus Bilogicals), and anti-SMAD4 as previously described38. Signal detection for immunohistochemistry was accomplished with Dako LSAB+System-HRP. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.
An additional cohort of pancreatic cancer resection samples was prospectively acquired through the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Network and the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative (http://www.pancreaticcancer.net.au/apgi). Consent was obtained for genomic sequencing through the Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative (APGI) for each individual patient following approval from Human Research Ethics Committees (HREC) at participating sites (Sydney South West Area Health Service HREC Western Zone, 2006/054; Sydney Local Health Network HREC RPA Zone, X11-0220 and North Sydney Central Coast Health, Harbour HREC, 0612-251M). We extracted RNA from tumour samples using the Qiagen Allprep(r) Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, assayed for quality on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), and subsequently hybridized to Illumina Human HT-12 V4 microarrays. Raw idat files were processed using IlluminaGeneExpressionIdatReader (Cowley et al. manuscript in preparation). Following array quality control, these data were vs.t transformed, and then robust spline normalized, using the lumi R/Bioconductor package. For the ICGC-APGI cohort, we assumed a proportional hazard: that the probability of death is the same for those censored as for those remaining on study.
For the TMA and expression array cohorts, median survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the difference was tested using the log-rank test. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For the TMA cohort, as few parameters were significant in univariate analysis, all were initially considered for Cox Proportional Hazard multivariate analysis in a backward elimination model, and assessed with the SPSS18 Software (IBM, Ehningen, Germany) with overall survival used as the primary endpoint. For the ICGC-APGI cohort, clinico-pathologic variables analyzed with a P-value of less than 0.25 on log-rank test were entered into Cox Proportional Hazard multivariate analysis and the model was resolved using backward elimination. Statistical analysis was performed using StatView 5.0 Software (Abacus Systems, Berkeley, CA, USA). Disease-specific survival was used as the primary endpoint.
