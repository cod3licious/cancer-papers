[Abstract, Methods]

A Small-Molecule Probe
of the Histone Methyltransferase
G9a Induces Cellular Senescence in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma. Post-translational modifications of histones alter chromatin structure and play key roles in gene expression and specification of cell states. Small molecules that target chromatin-modifying enzymes selectively are useful as probes and have promise as therapeutics, although very few are currently available. G9a (also named euchromatin histone methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2)) catalyzes methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9), a modification linked to aberrant silencing of tumor-suppressor genes, among others. Here, we report the discovery of a novel histone methyltransferase inhibitor, BRD4770. This compound reduced cellular levels of di- and trimethylated H3K9 without inducing apoptosis, induced senescence, and inhibited both anchorage-dependent and -independent proliferation in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. ATM-pathway activation, caused by either genetic or small-molecule inhibition of G9a, may mediate BRD4770-induced cell senescence. BRD4770 may be a useful tool to study G9a and its role in senescence and cancer cell biology.

Methods
Cell Culture and Compound Treatment
PANC-1 and HeLa
cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS
and 100 U mL-1 penicillin-streptomycin. BRD4770,
BRD9539, BRD2502, BRD9398, BRD1490, and BI-37 were synthesized in
our lab. Chemical characterization of BRD4770 and BRD9539 is included
in Supporting Information. BIX-01294, UNC0638,
and chaetocin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Enzymatic Assays
Biochemical activity of G9a was measured
as described.6 Biochemical assays for SUV39H1
and DNMT1 activity were from BPS Bioscience. Chaetocin was used as
a positive control in G9a and SUV39H1 assays. PRC2 and NSD2 activity
were measured using dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay
(DELFIA) in white 384-well streptavidin-coated plates (PerkinElmer).
For detailed assay procedure please see Supporting
Information.
Mass-Spectrometric Analysis of Histone Methylation
HeLa cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and treated with BRD4770 or
DMSO for 24 h. Histones were extracted according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Abcam). Histone bands were isolated from SDS-PAGE gel and
treated with double propionylation and trypsin. Samples were analyzed
on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer as described.6
Gene Silencing
Small-interfering RNAs against GLP (s36392)
and G9a (s21469, s21470) were obtained from Applied Biosystems. siRNAs
(25 nM) were transfected into PANC-1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen), with medium changed 24 h later. Transfected cells were
cultured for 72 h, and RNA and protein were collected for real-time
PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively.
Western Blotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
1% (w/v) NP-40, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mM b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4,
1 mg mL-1 leupeptin, protease inhibitor and
phosphatase inhibitor). Total protein was separated by 4-12%
SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (iBlot system, Invitrogen).
Blots were developed using chemiluminescence detection (SuperSignal,
Thermo Fisher Scientific Image Station 4000MM Pro, Kodak). Images
were quantified using ImageJ image analysis software. Antibody concentrations
are included as Supporting Information.
Immunofluorescence and Microscopy
PANC-1 cells were
seeded in black optical 96-well plates and treated with compounds
for 72 h. Cells were fixed using 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20
min, permeabilized for 20 min with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, blocked
with PBS containing 2% (w/v) BSA at 4 degC overnight, and incubated
at 4 degC overnight with either p-ATM (S1981) mouse mAb (10H11.E12,
Cell Signaling) or p-ATR (S428) rabbit Ab (Cell Signaling) at 1:250
dilution. Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
were added with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) and observed with an Axiovert
200 M fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) at 400X magnification. Cell
number analysis was performed on an ImageXpress Micro automated microscope
(Molecular Devices) using a 4X objective with laser-based focusing.
Image analysis was performed using the Cell Count module in the MetaXpress
software application (Molecular Devices).
Senescence Analysis
PANC-1 cells were seeded in 12-well
plates, treated with compounds and siRNAs, and stained with Senescence
b-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling), with detection
of blue color by light microscopy.
Anchorage-Independent Soft Agarose Assay
PANC-1 cells
were seeded and treated with BRD4770 in 6-well plates for 72 h. Cells
were trypsinized and tested for soft agar colony formation using CytoSelect
96-Well Cell Transformation Assay (Cell Biolabs), using the CyQuant
GR dye to measure total cellular nucleic acid levels. Fluorescence
was detected with an Analyst HT plate reader (LJL Biosystems) using
a 485/520 nm filter set.
Flow Cytometry
Treated cells were washed in PBS, fixed
in ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol for 30 min at 4 degC, followed by
two washes with PBS. Next, 100 mg mL-1 RNase
was added and incubated at 37 degC for 15 min, 50 mg mL-1 propidium iodide was added, and cell cycle was analyzed
with a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
