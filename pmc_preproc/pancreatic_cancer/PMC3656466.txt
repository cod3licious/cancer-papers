Glutamine supports pancreatic cancer growth through a Kras-regulated metabolic pathway. Cancer cells exhibit metabolic dependencies that distinguish them from their normal counterparts1. Among these addictions is an increased utilization of the amino acid glutamine (Gln) to fuel anabolic processes2. Indeed, the spectrum of Gln-dependent tumors and the mechanisms whereby Gln supports cancer metabolism remain areas of active investigation. Here we report the identification of a non-canonical pathway of Gln utilization in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells that is required for tumor growth. While most cells utilize glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1) to convert Gln-derived glutamate (Glu) into a-ketoglutarate in the mitochondria to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, PDAC relies on a distinct pathway to fuel the TCA cycle such that Gln-derived aspartate is transported into the cytoplasm where it can be converted into oxaloacetate (OAA) by aspartate transaminase (GOT1). Subsequently, this OAA is converted into malate and then pyruvate, ostensibly increasing the NADPH/NADP+ ratio which can potentially maintain the cellular redox state. Importantly, PDAC cells are strongly dependent on this series of reactions, as Gln deprivation or genetic inhibition of any enzyme in this pathway leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species and a reduction in reduced glutathione. Moreover, knockdown of any component enzyme in this series of reactions also results in a pronounced suppression of PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we establish that the reprogramming of Gln metabolism is mediated by oncogenic Kras, the signature genetic alteration in PDAC, via the transcriptional upregulation and repression of key metabolic enzymes in this pathway. The essentiality of this pathway in PDAC and the fact that it is dispensable in normal cells may provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat these refractory tumors.

Methods Summary
Proliferation and clonogenic assays were performed as previously described23. To characterize Gln metabolism, targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed4. Briefly, cells were grown in complete media and transferred into Gln-free media supplemented with [U-13C5]-Gln overnight (steady state) or for the indicated timepoints (flux analyses). For subcutaneous xenografts, PDAC cells infected with lentivrial shRNAs to suppress target gene expression were suspended in 100 ul HBSS and injected subcutaneously into the lower flank of NCr nude mice. For mouse xenografts, murine PDAC cells stably infected with a doxycycline-inducible GOT1 shRNA construct were injected. Animals were fed with doxycycline water starting on the day of injection or when tumor volume reached ~50mm3. Complete images of western blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 21.

Methods
Cell culture
Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection or the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. All cell lines were tested routinely, and prior to all metabolomic analyses, for mycoplasma contamination. RPMI-1640, fetal bovine serum and dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS) were purchased from Invitrogen. Glucose free DMEM (containing 2 mM Gln), dimethyl aKG, Asp, GSH reduced ethyl ester, OAA, dimethyl malate and DMEM power (without glucose and Gln) were obtained from Sigma, and Gln-free RPMI 1640 was purchased from Cellgro. Cosmic calf serum (CCS) was obtained from Thermo Scientific. Cells were cultured in the following media: 8988T, Panc1, MPanc96, Miapaca2 and PL45 in DMEM supplemented with 10 mM glucose and 10% CCS; 8902 in RPMI with 10% CCS; IMR90 in MEM with 10% FBS; HPDE cells were cultured as described previously24. Primary human PDAC lines were generated from ascites fluid under IRB approved protocols 02-240 and 2007P001918. Lines were sequenced and confirmed to have Kras mutations.
Cell proliferation assay
Cells were plated in 24-well plates at 2,000 cells per well in 0.5 mL of media. To deprive Gln, cells were plated in complete culture media (10mM glucose and 2mM Gln) which was exchanged with Gln-free medium supplemented with 10% dFBS the following day. Media was not changed throughout the course of the experiment. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed in 10% formalin and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Dye was extracted with 10% acetic acid and the relative proliferation was determined by OD at 595 nm.
Clonogenic assay
Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 300 cells per well in 2 mL of media. Media was not changed throughout the course of the experiment. After 7-10 days, colonies were fixed in 80% methanol and stained with 0.2% crystal violet.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcription was performed from 2 ug of total RNA using oligo-dT and MMLV HP reverse transcriptase (Epicentre), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green dye using an Mx3000PTM (Stratagene). PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and the relative amount of cDNA was calculated by the comparative CT method using the 18S ribosomal RNA sequences as a control. Primer sequences available upon request.
Xenograft studies
For subcutaneous xenografts, 8988T cells were infected with lentiviral shRNAs targeting GLUD1 (n=2), GOT1 (n=2), MDH1 (n=2), ME1 (n=2) and GFP (control hairpin, n=1) and subjected to a short puromycin selection (2 ug/mL); shRNA sequences below. 1.5x106 cells, suspended in 100 uL Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS), were injected subcutaneously into the lower flank of NCr nude mice (Taconic). Tumor length and width were measured twice weekly and the volume was calculated according to the formula (length x width2)/2. All xenograft experiments with human PDAC lines were approved by the HMS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol number 04-605. For mouse xenografts, a doxycycline-inducible GOT1 shRNA construct was first generated. For generation of the construct, oligonucleotides to mouse GOT1 shRNA (forward : CCGGCCACATGAGAAGACGTTTCTTCTCGAGAAGAAACGTCTTCTCATGTGGTTTTTG; reverse : AATTCAAAAACCACATGAGAAGACGTTTCTTCTCGAGAAGAAACGTCTTCTCATGTGG) were digested to generate sticky ends (AgeI and EcoRI) and immediately subcloned into the AgeI-EcoRI sites of the pLKO-Tet-on vector. For subcutaneous xenograft, 106 stably infected murine PDAC cells were suspended in 100 ul Hanks Buffered Saline Solution and injected subcutaneously into the lower flank of NCr nude mice (Taconic). Animals were fed with doxycycline water (doxycycline 2g/L, sucrose 20g/L) starting on the day of injection or when tumor diameter reached 50mm. Tumor volumes were measured every third day starting from day 4 post-injection and calculated as above. These xenograft experiments were approved under MDACC IACUC protocol 111113931.
Western blot analysis
After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond-N Nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), prior to incubation with the primary antibody overnight at 4deg. The membranes were then washed with TBS-T followed by exposure to the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1h and visualized on Kodak X-ray film using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Thermo Scientific). The following antibodies were used: Kras (F234, Santa Cruz), GOT1 (NBP1-54778, Novus), GLUD1 (ab55061, Abcam) and b-Actin (A2066, Sigma).
ROS Quantification
DCFDA assay was performed 24hr after supplementing Gln-free media with either OAA (4mM) or dimethyl malate (4mM). Cells were incubated with 5uM 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, Invitrogen) for 30 min. Excess DCFDA was removed by washing the cells twice with PBS, and labeled cells were then trypsinized, rinsed, and resuspended in PBS. Oxidation of DCFDA to the highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichloro-fluorescein (DCF) is proportionate to ROS generation and was analyzed by flow cytometry.
Metabolomics
For steady state metabolomic analysis, PDAC cell lines were grown to ~50% confluence in growth media (DMEM, 2 mM Gln, 10 mM glucose, 10% CCS) on 10 cm dishes in biological quadruplicate. A complete media change was performed two hours prior to metabolite collection. To trace Gln metabolism, PDAC cell lines were grown as above and then transferred into Gln-free DMEM (with 10 mM glucose) containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 2 mM [U-13C5]-Gln (Cambridge Isotope Labs) overnight (for steady state labeling) or for the indicated timepoints in the flux analyses. Additionally, fresh media containing [U-13C5]-Gln was exchanged 2 hr prior to metabolite extraction for steady state analyses. The quantity of the metabolite fraction analyzed was adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration calculated upon processing a parallel 10cm dish. Metabolite fractions were collected and analyzed by targeted LC-MS/MS via selected reaction monitoring (SRM), as described5,14. Processed data was analyzed in Cluster 3.0 and TreeViewer.
Measurement of Sensitization of PDAC cells to ROS
PDAC cell lines were plated into 96-well plates at 103 cells/well in 200 uL of growth media. The following day, growth media was replaced with that containing GLS inhibitors and/or H2O2. Parallel plates were analyzed at 3, 6 and 9 days by Cell Titer Glo analysis (Promega), per the manufacturer's instruction. The GLS inhibitors 968 (active) and 365 (structurally similar, inactive) were provided as a kind gift from the Cerione laboratory9. BPTES was a kind gift from Jaime Escobedo (Forma Therapeutics).

All shRNA vectors were obtained from the RNA Interference Screening Facility of Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The sequences and RNAi Consortium clone IDs for each shRNA are as follows. shGLS-1 : GCACAGACATGGTTGGTATAT (TRCN0000051135), shGLS-2 : GCCCTGAAGCAGTTCGAAATA (TRCN0000051136), shMDH1-1 : CCCTGTTGTAATCAAGAATAA (TRCN0000221892), shMDH1-2 : GCAACAGATAAAGAAGACGTT (TRCN0000221893), shME1-1 : GCCTTCAATGAACGGCCTATT (TRCN0000064728), shME1-2 : CCAACAATATAGTTTGGTGTT (TRCN0000064729), shGLUD1-1, CCCAAGAACTATACTGATAAT (TRCN0000220878), shGLUD1-2 : GCAGAGTTCCAAGACAGGATA (TRCN0000220880), shGOT1-1 : GCGTTGGTACAATGGAACAAA (TRCN0000034784), shGOT1-2 : GCTAATGACAATAGCCTAAAT (TRCN0000034785), shGPT2-1 : CGGCATTTCTACGATCCTGAA (TRCN0000035024), shGPT2-2 : CCATCAAATGGCTCCAGACAT (TRCN0000035025), shPSAT1-1 : GCCAAGAAGTTTGGGACTATA (TRCN0000035264), shPSAT1-2 : CCAGACAACTATAAGGTGATT (TRCN0000035265), shKras-1 : CCTCGTTTCTACACAGAGAAA (TRCN0000040148), shKras-2 : GAGGGCTTTCTTTGTGTATTT (TRCN0000033260).
Regents
NADP+/NADPH ratios were determined using the NADP/NADPH assay kit (Abcam; ab65349) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 105 cells (n=6 wells of a 6-well dish) were collected on ice in extraction buffer and subject to two rounds of freeze-thaw at -80degC. NADP+ and NADPH values were determined in biological sextuplet and concentration was obtained by comparison to standard curves. OAA was not analyzed by targeted LC/MS-MS due to its limited stability in aqueous solvents at room temperature25. As such, the abundance of this metabolite was determined using a quantification kit (Biovision), according the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 2x106 cells (n=4 10cm dishes) were collected during log-phase growth by trypsinization, re-suspended immediately in the buffers provided (on ice), analyzed and compared to standard curves. The signals obtained were normalized to the protein concentration calculated upon processing a parallel 10cm dish. NEAA mixture consisted of a mixture of 0.1 mM glycine, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, proline and serine.
