CYTOCHROME P450 17A1 STRUCTURES WITH PROSTATE CANCER DRUGS ABIRATERONE AND TOK-001. Cytochrome P450 17A1 (P450c17) catalyzes the biosynthesis of androgens in humans1. Since prostate cancer cells proliferate in response to androgen steroids2,3, CYP17A1 inhibition is a new strategy to prevent androgen synthesis and treat lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer4, but drug development has been hampered by the lack of a CYP17A1 structure. Here we report the only known structures of CYP17A1, which contain either abiraterone, a first-in-class steroidal inhibitor recently approved by the FDA for late-stage prostate cancer5, or TOK-001, another inhibitor in clinical trials4,6. Both bind the heme iron forming a 60deg angle above the heme plane, packing against the central I helix with the 3b-OH interacting with N202 in the F helix. Importantly, this binding mode differs substantially from those predicted by homology models or from steroids in other cytochrome P450 enzymes with known structures, with some features more similar to steroid receptors. While the overall CYP17A1 structure provides a rationale for understanding many mutations found in patients with steroidogenic diseases, the active site reveals multiple steric and hydrogen bonding features that will facilitate better understanding of the enzyme's dual hydroxylase and lyase catalytic capabilities and assist in rational drug design. Specifically, structure-based design is expected to aid development of inhibitors that bind only CYP17A1 and solely inhibit its androgen-generating lyase activity to improve treatment of prostate and other hormone-responsive cancers.

Methods Summary
A synthetic cDNA for human CYP17A1 was modified to delete residues 2-19, substitute the hydrophilic sequence 20RRCP23 with 20AKKT23, and add a C-terminal four histidine tag (fig. S6) before cloning into the pCWori+ plasmid and overexpression in E. coli JM109 cells. Protein was purified by nickel affinity, cation exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. Abiraterone was synthesized (Methods). Binding affinities were determined using a UV/vis spectral shift assay. Progesterone 17a-hydroxylation was evaluated using HPLC separation and UV detection. For crystallography, inhibitors were included throughout purification. Crystals were grown from CYP17A1 (30 mg/mL) complexed with inhibitor using hanging-drop vapor diffusion to equilibrate against 30% PEG 3350, 0.175 M Tris, pH 8.5, 0.30 M ammonium sulfate, and 3% glycerol. Diffraction data was collected and phased by molecular replacement. Iterative model building and refinement generated the final model. Substrates were docked using Surflex-Dock30.

Methods
Synthesis and characterization of abiraterone, 17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-5,16-dien-3b-ol
A stirred solution of 17-iodoandrosta-5,16-dien-3b-ol (600 mg, 1.5 mmol) in THF (20mL) in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask was purged with argon. Bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (II) chloride catalyst (11 mg, 0.016 mmol) was added, followed by diethyl(3-pyridyl)borane (265 mg, 1.8 mmol). To the resultant orange solution, an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (2M, 5 mL) was added. The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser and the apparatus purged again with argon. The mixture was then heated under reflux (~80 degC) with stirring for 4 days then allowed to cool. The mixture was poured into water and extracted with hot toluene (3x30 mL). The toluene extracts were dried (Na2CO3) and concentrated. Column chromatography was performed with Et2O/toluene (1:2) as the eluent to give abiraterone (350 mg, 66%) as a white crystalline solid: mp 228-230 degC; IR nmax 3307 cm-1 (OH str); 1H NMR d 1.07 (s, 3, H-19), 1,09 (s, 3, H-18), 3.54 (m, 1, H-3a), 5,41 (dm, 1, J = 5.2 Hz, H-6), 6.01 (m, 1, H-16), 7.24 (dd, 1, pyridyl H-5), 7.66 (dd, 1, pyridyl H-4), 8.47 (dd, 1, pyridyl H-6), 8.63 (d, 1, pyridyl H-2); 13C NMR d 151.69, 147.92, 147.84, 141.19, 133.68, 132.98, 129.24, 123.03, 121.32, 71.65, 57.56, 50.36, 47.34, 42.32, 37.19, 36.71, 35.26, 31.81, 31.64, 30.45, 20.88, 19.35, 16.59. The HRMS calculated m/z C24H32NO [M+H]+ is 350.2484. The experimental value was 350.2491. Abiraterone was 99% pure by LCMS.
CYP17A1 design, expression, and purification
The human CYP17A1 cDNA was synthesized with codon optimization for E. coli expression (Blue Heron Biotechnology, Bothell, WA). A truncated and His-tagged construct was generated by truncation of the N-terminal transmembrane helix (D2-19), substitution of 20RRCP23 with 20AKKT23, and addition of a C-terminal four-residue histidine tag (fig. S6). N-terminal modifications were designed to increase solubility. This altered cDNA was inserted into the pCWori+ expression vector and expressed in E. coli JM109 cells.
Cells were grown, harvested, and disrupted as described10,31. After centrifugation (5000 x g), CYP17A1 was solubilized with either 4.8 mM Cymal-5 (for crystallography; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) or 2% Emulgen 913 (for assays; Desert Biologicals, Phoenix, AZ), followed by ultracentrifugation (80,000 x g) for 60 minutes. The lysate was loaded onto a NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) column and purified as reported31. Eluted CYP17A1 fractions were pooled, diluted 5-fold with CM buffer (50mM Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 100 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA), and loaded on a HiTrap CM fast flow column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein was eluted in CM buffer with 0.5 M NaCl, concentrated to ~1 mL, and loaded on a Superdex 200 16/60 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare). For crystallography 10 mM abiraterone or TOK-001 (Shanghai Haoyuan Chemexpress Co., Shanghai, China) was added to all buffers.
Protein crystallization, data collection, and structure determination
CYP17A1 crystals were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion equilibration. CYP17A1 (30 mg/mL) in CM buffer supplemented with 10 mM abiraterone or TOK-001, 2.4 mM Cymal-5, and 0.5 M NaCl was equilibrated against 30% PEG 3350, 0.175 M Tris, pH 8.5, 0.30 M ammonium sulfate, and 3% glycerol at 20 C. Crystals were cryoprotected in 7:1 mother liquor:ethylene glycol and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Native data sets were collected at 0.98 A, 100 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9-2. Data were processed using Mosflm32 and Scala33. The abiraterone complex was solved by molecular replacement using BALBES34 with a final search model based on CYP2R1 (PDB 3CZH) and the TOK-001 structure solved using Phaser33 with the abiraterone structure as a search model. Model building and refinement were accomplished iteratively using COOT35 and Refmac536 in CCP433. Structure validation was performed using WHATCHECK37 and PROCHECK38. Ramachandran plot analysis reveals percent favorable/additional allowed/generously allowed/disallowed residues are 86.3/13.2/0.5/0.0 (abiraterone structure) and 86.2/13.3/0.5/0.0 (TOK-001 structure). X-ray statistics are provided (Table S1). Probe-occupied voids were calculated using VOIDOO40 (probe radius=1.4 A; grid mesh=0.4 A). All figures were prepared using MacPyMOL39.
Docking
The CYP17A1 active site was defined as described for other cytochromes P45040 with the addition of an oxygen molecule directly coordinated to the heme to mimic Compound I of the cytochrome P450 catalytic cycle. Substrate coordinates were prepared and energy minimized with SYBYL (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Charges were assigned using the Gasteiger and Marsili method. Surflex-Dock (Tripos International, St. Louis, Missouri) was used to dock ligands as previously described40. The active site was a 10 A sphere around the heme and pregnenolone. Movement of pregnenolone within the active site was not substantial with the distance of C17 to O=Fe(IV) 4.5 A, C16 to O=Fe(IV) of 4.5 A, and a distance from C21 to O=Fe(IV) of 3.0 A for the lowest energy pose.
Enzyme activity and IC50 determinations
Progesterone 17a-hydroxylation was evaluated using a modified HPLC method with UV-detection41. CYP17A1 (50 pmol) and rat NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase42 1:4 were mixed, incubated on ice (20 minutes), and added to buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and 5 mM MgCl2) containing progesterone (0 - 50 mM) to a total volume of 500 mL. Phosphatidylcholine (25 mg) was included for side-by-side kinetic comparisons with the full-length enzyme10. For IC50 determinations, inhibitors concentrations were 0-1500 nM for abiraterone and 0-3000 nM for TOK-001. After warming (37deg C, 3 minutes), reactions were initiated by NADPH addition (20 mL 25 mM), incubated for 10 minutes (37deg C), and quenched with 20% trichloroacetic acid (300 mL) and placed on ice. The 17a-hydroxyprogesterone metabolite was identified by UV detection at 248 nm following HPLC separation and coeluted with authentic standards. The HPLC mobile phase was 40% acetonitrile, 60% water with 1% acetic acid and run at 1 mL/min (Phenomenex, Luna 5 m, C18, 50 x 4.6 mm).
Ligand binding assays
Ligand binding assays based on spectral differences detected upon ligand titration were performed essentially as described40 except that the CYP17A1 concentration was 0.1 mM, the path length was 5 cm, and the tight binding equation was used.
Functional data was analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and presented as mean +- standard error.
