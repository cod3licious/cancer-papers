[Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion]

Androgen receptor coactivator p120 subtype ? is highly expressed in prostate cancer. Purpose: The b form of p120 is reported to be a strong coactivator of the androgen receptor. We investigated the gene expression profiles of the a and b forms of p120 in prostate cancer cell lines, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), nontreated prostate cancer (NTPC), and prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy (PCA-ADT).   Methods: We obtained 154 prostate needle biopsy specimens (81 in BPH, 51 in NTPC, and 22 in PCA-ADT). Levels of p120a and b expression were determined by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction.   Results: Prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP, PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP-LA, which is a derivative of LNCaP under androgen deprivation, expressed both p120a and p120b. p120a expression levels were significantly higher than those of p120b in all cell lines examined. In human prostate tissues, p120a expression was significantly higher than that of p120b in BPH and NTPC. p120a expression in BPH was significantly higher than in other groups. In contrast, p120b expression was significantly higher in NTPC and PCA-ADT than in BPH. Expression of the two forms of p120 was not correlated with age, prostate-specific antigen, or Gleason score.   Conclusions: The expression profiles of p120a and p120b significantly differ in cancerous and benign prostatic tissues.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and is second only to lung cancer as the most common non-cutaneous cancer diagnosed in males in the United States [1]. In Japan, the incidence of prostate cancer is increasing rapidly [2]. Curative options for prostate cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Huggins and Hodges [3] treated a patient with progressive prostate cancer by castration in 1941, and administration of ADT improved his condition. ADT has since been widely used as the gold standard for prostate cancer.
Prolonged treatment is, however, limited by the development of resistance. ADT with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, alone or combined with an antiandrogenic agent, is the most widely performed hormonal therapy. Various mechanisms of reduced susceptibility to ADT have been proposed. These include over-expression of androgen receptors (AR) [4], variations in AR [5], activation of ARs that do not bind androgens and other hormones [6], and cofactor abnormalities involving androgen production within prostate cancer cells [7]. AR associates with coactivator or corepressor proteins that modulate its activation in the presence of ligand. Alterations in AR coactivator expression or function in prostate cancer include colocalization with AR in aggregates (mutated AR) [8], potentiation of the agonistic effect of hydroxyflutamide [9], and potentiation of various AR activations [10]. Increased expression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and transcriptional intermediary factors-2 (TIF-2), which are AR coactivators, has been reported in castration-refractory prostate cancer (CRPC) tissue, and RAC-3 (SRC-3) expression is reportedly increased in poorly differentiated carcinomas and advanced tumors. Other cofactors (e.g., competitive protein binding, androgen receptor activation [ARA]70, ARA55) showing altered expression in prostate cancer have also been identified [7].
A nuclear general receptor coactivator, p120, was originally cloned as a coactivator of thyroid receptor (TR) [11]. p120 consisted of 920 amino acids and showed significant homology to skeletal muscle abundant protein. Various human tissues express p120 mRNA, including the heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas. A novel splice variant of p120 (p120a), p120b was cloned in our university [12], and has been reported to be the strong co-activator of AR. In most tissues, p120b expression levels were lower than those of p120a, whereas prostate tissues express predominantly p120b. The authors suggested that p120b affects hormone sensitivity in prostate cancer. However, analysis of the expression patterns of p120a and p120b were based on semiquantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using as a small number of prostate samples. In the present study, we developed a more accurate quantification method, using multiplex real time PCR, and evaluated the expression profiles of p120a and p120b in large numbers of samples to confirm the role of p120 in prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
1.
Cells and chemicals
The human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). DU145 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), and PC-3 and LNCaP in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Moregate Biotech, Bulimba, Australia). LNCaP-LA was used as an in vitro model of CRPC, and were derived from LNCaP cells cultured with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS for 2 years. The RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA, USA) was used for RNA isolation and cDNA was synthesized using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random primers (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols [13].

Multiplex real time PCR for p120a and p120b detection
We designed specific primers for detection of p120a and p120b (Fig. 1). As an internal control, 18S RNA copy numbers were determined. The p120a and p120b 18S RNA primer sets are shown in Table 1. The 18S1 set was for p120a, and the 18S2 set for p120b. Multiplex real time PCR was performed using 2 x iQSupermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), using 300 nM of each p120 primer, 200 nM p120 probe, 300 nM of each 18S primer, 200 nM 18S probe, 2.4 mL of water, and 1 mL of the template. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles at 95degC for 5 seconds, 60degC for 10 seconds, and 95degC for 10 seconds. The real time PCR assays were carried out in 96-well plates using CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). Standard curves for each transcript are shown in Fig. 2.

Prostate biopsy specimens
All prostate biopsy specimens were obtained at the Gunma University Hospital between 2002 and 2009, as described previously [14]. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Fifty one nontreated prostate cancer (NTPC) samples, 81 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples, and 22 prostate cancer samples that had many viable cells remaining after ADT for 6 months prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy (PCA-ADT) were obtained. Prostate biopsy after 6 months of ADT was intended for pathological evaluation of ADT. Table 2 shows the characteristics of the patients. NTPC and PCA-ADT samples were selected based on their mulitple positive cores.

Statistical analyses
Differences between the two groups were evaluated using the Student's t-test. A two-sided P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

p120a and b expression profiles in prostate cancer cell lines (Table 3)
Both p120a and b were expressed in all four cell lines. p120a, p120b, and b/a expression values are expressed as relative ratios vs. those of p120a in LNCaP. The expression levels of p120a showed no significant differences among the four cell lines. LNCaP-LA expressed p120b at a significantly higher level than PC-3 (P<0.05) or DU145 (P<0.01). b/a ratios were not significantly different among the four cell lines.

p120a and p120b expression profiles in human prostate tissues
In prostate cancer cell lines, p120a was expressed at a significantly higher level than p120b. Next, we compared the expression levels in human prostate cancer tissues. As shown in Fig. 3, expression levels of p120a were significantly higher than those of p120b in the BPH and NTPC groups, while there was no significant difference in the PCA-ADT group.
Next, we compared expression levels of p120a and p120b, and b/a ratios among three groups. As shown in Fig. 4, expression levels of p120a in the BPH group were significantly higher than those in the NTPC, but not in the PCA-ADT group. In contrast, p120b expression levels were significantly lower in the BPH group than in the other two NTPC and PCAADT groups. Thus, the b/a ratios were significantly lower in the BPH group compared with the NTPC and PCA-ADT groups. No significant difference in the expression levels of each variant or the ratios in any group in terms of age, prostate-specific antigen levels, or Gleason score were observed.

DISCUSSION
The nuclear coactivator, p120, has at least two splicing variants; p120b was cloned and characterized at our university [12]. Although p120a acts as a coactivator of many nuclear receptors, including AR, TR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g, retinoid X receptor, glucocorticoid receptor and androgen receptor, the affinity of p120b for AR is strong [12]. In the present study, we quantified and compared the expression levels of both isoforms among prostate cancer cells and human prostate tissues. Hosoya et al. [12] using real time PCR reported that in prostate tissues p120b expression was predominant. They also showed that prostate cancer tissues expressed high levels of p120b and that b/a ratios were higher in newly diagnosed prostate cancer tissues than in recurrent prostate cancer. In the current study, p120a was found to predominate in BPH and NTPC samples. These results differ from previous reports. One reason for the discrepancy may be the quantification method. As mentioned earlier, relative expression levels were determined by the band intensity obtained by conventional real time PCR, as reported previously [12]. For semiquantification of gene expression levels in real time PCR, selection of the optimal cycle number for PCR at which transcripts are amplified exponentially is necessary. The previous study showed a PCR product profile after 40 cycles; thus we suggest that the quantification method might be the reason for the discrepancy. In the present study, p120a and p120b transcripts were detected separately with reference to the internal controls (Fig. 2). Another reason for the discrepancy may be the sample size. We used a large number of samples in this study. However, Hosoya et al. [12] evaluated only four non-cancerous tissues, 10 nontreated cancer tissues, and three recurrent prostate cancer tissues. To overcome this limitation of needle biopsy samples, we selected patients with multiple positive cores in biopsy samples.
Another finding of this study was that expression levels of p120b, a strong coactivator of AR, were significantly higher in the NTPC and PCA-ADT groups compared with the BPH group. Of the tested AR coactivators, SRC-1 and TIF-2 exhibited increased expression in CRPC. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT-1 and Ran/ara24 exhibited increased expression in NTPC. RAC-3 (SRC-3) expression was increased in poorly differentiated carcinomas and advanced tumors. Expression of ELE1/ARA70 in NTPC was decreased, and no changes in the expression of other coactivators, including ARA54, ARA55, TMF/ARA160, SRC1, and thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 220, between benign prostate tissue and NTPC was apparent [15]. The expression profiles of p120a and p120b in prostate tissues we report here suggest that a nuclear coactivator, in particular, p120b, might play a role in prostate cancer. The expression levels of p120a in the BPH group were significantly higher than those in the NTPC, but not in the PCA-ADT group, while p120b expression levels were significantly lower in the BPH group than prostate cancer group regardless of previous ADT. These findings might suggest that p120b plays a role in the development of prostate cancer, while expression of p120a is primarily involved in the response of prostate cancer cells to ADT. To explore the exact mechanisms underlying the different expression profiles of p120, further studies are needed.
In conclusion, we developed a precise multiplex real time PCR method for quantification of p120a and p120b gene expression. Prostate tissues, noncancerous or cancerous, predominantly expressed p120a over p120b. p120b, which is a strong coactivator of the AR, was expressed at significantly higher levels in both nontreated and post-ADT prostate cancer tissues. These observations suggested that the expression profiles of p120a and p120b significantly differ in cancerous and benign prostatic tissues.
